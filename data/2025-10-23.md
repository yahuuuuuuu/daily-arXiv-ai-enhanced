Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes是一种神经生成的基准标记，能够自然地融入现实环境，通过视觉上微小的修改将任意图像转换为隐蔽的6自由度位置追踪标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准标记在美学和其他原因下显得突兀，需要一种能够隐蔽地融入环境的追踪解决方案。

Method: 使用受深度隐写术启发的端到端流程，联合训练一系列网络模块来创建和检测Ninja Codes，通过编码器网络对图像进行视觉上微小的修改。

Result: 实验证明Ninja Codes在常见室内光照条件下能够提供可靠的位置追踪，同时成功隐藏在各种环境纹理中。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在传统基准标记因外观显眼而不适用的场景中具有特殊价值，可用于增强现实、机器人技术等应用。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段的自动驾驶视觉问答系统，通过精心设计的提示和上下文增强，显著提升了预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够回答高级感知、预测和规划问题的自动驾驶视觉问答系统，通过改进提示工程和上下文增强来提升现有模型的性能。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用大型多模态LLM（Qwen2.5-VL-32B），输入六摄像头数据、历史时间窗口和思维链提示；第二阶段增强提示，添加场景元数据和任务特定指令。使用自一致性集成提高答案可靠性。

Result: 在驾驶QA基准测试中显著优于基线模型：第一阶段使用5个历史帧和10-shot提示达到65.1%准确率，自一致性提升至66.85%；第二阶段达到67.37%总体准确率。在严重视觉损坏下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示工程和上下文增强可以大幅提升预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的性能。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D模型，一种用于纵向医学图像分析的新型状态空间架构，能够有效处理不规则时间间隔的高分辨率图像序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纵向放射学图像分析中的数据挑战：如何有效建模不规则时间间隔捕获的高分辨率图像序列，充分利用其中的空间和时间线索。

Method: 采用连续时间选择性扫描机制，将真实检查时间差整合到状态转换中，并配合多尺度3D邻域融合模块来捕获时空关系。

Result: 在乳腺癌风险预测基准测试中表现优异，验证c-index提高2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC得分高于现有的循环、变换器和状态空间模型变体。

Conclusion: 该模型凭借线性复杂度能够高效处理长而复杂的患者筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动中心对齐框架，通过从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，并将其与文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征对齐，从而提升生成视频的时间一致性和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频扩散模型在生成复杂运动时往往缺乏时间一致性和物理合理性，主要原因是模型对复杂运动理解不足。现有方法通过将扩散模型特征与预训练视频编码器特征对齐来解决此问题，但这些编码器的特征混合了视频外观和动态信息，限制了对齐效果。

Method: 1. 从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，该子空间经过优化以预测真实光流，确保捕获真实的运动动态。2. 将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征与这个新的运动子空间对齐，使生成模型能够内化运动知识。

Result: 该方法在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0等基准测试上进行了实证评估，并进行了用户研究。结果表明，该方法提升了最先进视频扩散模型的物理常识性，同时保持了与文本提示的契合度。

Conclusion: 提出的运动中心对齐框架通过解耦和专门的运动子空间对齐，有效提升了文本到视频扩散模型生成视频的时间一致性和物理合理性，为视频生成质量提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述评估的新指标，使用场景图作为结构化评分标准来指导LLM作为评判者，在DOCENT新数据集上比现有指标更好地匹配人类评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像描述评估指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本中的属性和关系错误，需要更细粒度的错误定位能力。

Method: PoSh使用场景图作为结构化评分标准，通过LLM作为评判者来生成基于细粒度错误的聚合分数，并引入DOCENT数据集进行验证。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上比最佳开源替代方案与人类判断的相关性提高了0.05 Spearman ρ，对图像类型具有鲁棒性，并且作为奖励函数优于标准监督微调。

Conclusion: PoSh和DOCENT为详细图像描述评估提供了更好的工具，发现基础模型在描述具有丰富场景动态的图像时难以实现无错误覆盖，为VLM进展建立了新的挑战性任务。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

### [7] [UniHPR: Unified Human Pose Representation via Singular Value Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19078)
*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHPR是一个统一的人体姿态表示学习框架，通过对比学习对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态嵌入，在人体姿态估计任务中取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对不同模态人体姿态表示之间相关性的系统研究，特别是在对比学习范式下。人体姿态表示在众多人机交互应用中至关重要。

Method: 提出统一的人体姿态表示学习管道UniHPR，使用基于奇异值的新型对比学习损失来同时对齐多个数据表示。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上MPJPE达到49.9mm，在3DPW数据集上PA-MPJPE达到51.6mm，并在Human3.6M上实现9.24mm MPJPE的姿态检索误差。

Conclusion: UniHPR通过对比学习有效对齐多模态人体姿态表示，在2D和3D人体姿态估计任务中表现出色，并支持跨模态姿态检索。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

TL;DR: 该研究提出将注意力机制集成到3D U-Net模型中，以改进脑肿瘤分割，并采用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法解决训练数据不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准U-Net模型在准确描绘脑肿瘤区域方面存在挑战，特别是在处理不规则形状和模糊边界时。此外，在高分辨率MRI数据上训练分割模型需要大量计算资源，并面临类别不平衡问题。

Method: 将注意力机制集成到3D U-Net模型中，使模型能够捕捉复杂细节并在分割过程中优先处理信息丰富的区域。同时使用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法来解决训练数据不平衡问题。

Result: 在BraTS 2020数据集上的评估显示，模型表现优于相关研究，Dice系数为0.975，特异性为0.988，敏感性为0.995。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型有效提高了脑肿瘤分割性能，为临床环境中可靠诊断提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究应用联邦近端学习(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据，结合改进的U-Net注意力机制模型，在保护患者隐私的同时实现了96%的肿瘤分割准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球女性主要死因，需要早期检测和准确诊断。医疗数据的敏感性使得开发准确且保护隐私的AI模型具有挑战性，而联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但在非独立同分布数据上训练会影响模型准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 采用联邦近端学习(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据集，并结合改进的U-Net模型，集成了注意力机制来增强肿瘤分割准确性。

Result: 该方法训练出的全局模型达到了96%的准确率，有效提升了肿瘤分割的准确性，同时保护了患者隐私。

Conclusion: FedProx方法在处理非独立同分布的本地医疗数据集训练精确机器学习模型方面具有潜力，是保护隐私的同时实现高准确率肿瘤分割的有前景方法。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和CECL方法，用于研究复杂3D环境中的多智能体决策，通过同步的第一人称视角视频流促进团队战术意识学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解研究主要依赖第三人称视角，忽视了多智能体学习的同步性和自我中心特性，需要从个体视角研究团队战术的涌现。

Method: 构建X-Ego-CS数据集（124小时专业级CS2比赛视频），提出CECL方法，通过对比学习对齐队友的自我中心视觉流来培养团队战术意识。

Result: 在队友-对手位置预测任务中，CECL方法有效提升了智能体从单一第一人称视角推断队友和对手位置的能力。

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电子竞技中的跨自我中心多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

*Warisa Nusrat,Mostafijur Rahman,Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文使用六种深度卷积网络对疟疾细胞图像进行分类，其中残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最佳，准确率分别达到97.28%和97.55%，证明了深度学习在疟疾自动检测中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疟疾主要通过雌性按蚊传播，常导致0-5岁儿童死亡。传统显微镜观察血涂片图像的方法依赖专家经验，存在误诊风险，因此需要计算机辅助的自动诊断系统。

Method: 应用六种深度卷积网络（AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、残差注意力网络、DenseNet-121和自定义CNN）从血细胞图像中提取深层特征，并进行疟疾感染细胞与健康细胞的分类。

Result: 在公开的疟疾细胞图像数据集上，残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最佳，平均准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现高度支持深度学习驱动的方法在疟疾自动可靠检测中的实际应用，同时最大限度地减少了直接人工参与。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

TL;DR: PruneHal是一种无需训练的方法，通过自适应KV缓存修剪来增强多模态大语言模型对关键视觉信息的关注，从而减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案要么引入额外数据进行训练，要么在推理时加入外部或内部信息，这些方法都会带来额外计算成本。研究发现MLLMs中的幻觉与对视觉token的注意力不足密切相关。

Method: 提出PruneHal方法，利用自适应KV缓存修剪来增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注，无需额外训练且几乎不增加推理成本。

Result: 在多个主流MLLMs和广泛使用的幻觉评估基准上测试，取得了稳健且出色的结果。

Conclusion: PruneHal是首个将token修剪应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，具有模型无关性，可无缝集成到不同的解码策略中。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly

*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Video Consistency Distance (VCD)指标，通过基于奖励的微调框架增强视频扩散模型的时序一致性，特别针对图像到视频生成任务中的时序不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于奖励的微调方法主要关注整个生成视频序列的质量（如美学吸引力和整体一致性），但在图像到视频生成任务中，时序一致性往往受到影响。

Method: 提出VCD指标，在视频帧特征的频域空间中定义，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧信息，并使用基于奖励的微调框架对模型进行微调。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验结果表明，使用VCD微调的视频生成模型显著提升了时序一致性，且不会降低其他性能。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的时序一致性增强方法，能够在不牺牲其他性能的前提下改善图像到视频生成任务的时序连贯性。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive是一个用于增强下游感知任务的合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知引导图分解和渲染技术生成多视角逼真视频，显著提升自动驾驶中的极端情况感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的驾驶世界模型主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽视了对于自动驾驶性能至关重要的下游感知任务的评估。现有方法需要先在合成数据上预训练再在真实数据上微调，导致训练周期加倍，当基线模型训练周期加倍时，合成数据的优势变得不明显。

Method: Dream4Drive首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，然后将3D资产渲染到这些引导图上，最后微调驾驶世界模型以生成编辑后的多视角逼真视频，用于训练下游感知模型。

Result: 该框架能够大规模生成多视角极端情况，显著提升自动驾驶中的极端情况感知能力。同时贡献了DriveObj3D大规模3D资产数据集，涵盖典型驾驶场景类别。

Conclusion: 综合实验表明，Dream4Drive在各种训练周期下都能有效提升下游感知模型的性能，为未来研究提供了有价值的工具和数据集。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

TL;DR: 提出了MoE-GS框架，将混合专家技术首次引入动态高斯泼溅，通过体积感知像素路由器自适应融合多个专家输出，提升渲染质量，并通过效率优化和蒸馏策略平衡性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景下表现不一致，没有单一方法能有效处理所有动态挑战，需要更统一和自适应的解决方案。

Method: 提出MoE-GS框架，集成多个专门专家，通过体积感知像素路由器将高斯级权重投影到像素空间进行自适应融合；同时探索单次多专家渲染、门控感知高斯剪枝和蒸馏策略来提升效率。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的广泛实验表明，MoE-GS在保持改进效率的同时，持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoE-GS是首个将混合专家技术融入动态高斯泼溅的方法，通过专家融合和效率优化策略，实现了更好的渲染质量和效率平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

TL;DR: SFGFusion是一种基于表面拟合的相机-4D成像雷达融合检测网络，通过估计物体二次表面参数来增强空间表示和跨模态交互，生成密集伪点云以缓解雷达点稀疏性问题，在BEV空间实现多模态融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D成像雷达具有低成本、长距离检测和精确速度测量的优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示和多模态融合效果。

Method: 通过图像和雷达数据估计物体二次表面参数，生成密集深度图；在图像分支中引导特征从透视视图转换到BEV空间；在表面伪点分支生成密集伪点云；采用基于pillar的方法处理点云特征，最终在BEV空间进行检测。

Result: 在TJ4DRadSet和view-of-delft(VoD)目标检测基准测试中表现出优越性能，有效融合了相机和4D雷达特征。

Conclusion: SFGFusion通过表面拟合指导的多模态融合方法，成功解决了4D成像雷达稀疏性问题，实现了更可靠的密集深度预测和准确的目标检测。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升GEO空间目标的检测性能，解决了弱信号和复杂背景下的检测难题

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

TL;DR: FadeLead是一个前景中心的协作感知框架，通过将背景上下文信息压缩到紧凑的前景特征中，在带宽受限的车联网中实现高效信息共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作感知中带宽限制问题，传统方法只传输前景区域特征而丢弃了包含重要上下文的背景信息，影响了感知性能。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，早期利用背景线索但逐步剪除，迫使模型将上下文信息内化到前景表示中，而不需要传输背景本身。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试中，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均优于现有方法，证明了上下文丰富的前景共享的有效性。

Conclusion: FadeLead通过将背景上下文压缩到前景特征中，在保持带宽效率的同时显著提升了协作感知性能，为车联网中的长尾场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了单步扩散模型的结构失真问题，实现了高效且高质量的真实图像超分辨率。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Motivation: 解决现有MAV动作识别方法计算量大、不适合资源受限平台的问题，平衡识别精度与推理速度之间的权衡。

Method: 采用MobileNetV4作为骨干网络，引入阶段式正交知识蒸馏(SOKD)策略从教师网络(ResNet18)向学生网络传递知识，集成参数自由注意力机制，开发混合损失训练策略。

Result: 在三个自收集数据集上平均识别精度达92.12%，仅消耗136.16 pJ能量，处理速度为8.84动作/秒，动作解码速度比领先方法快2倍。

Conclusion: MobiAct实现了低能耗、低计算的MAV动作识别，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了效率，适用于资源受限的MAV平台。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

Motivation: 现有方法只能使用可微的回归模型作为计数网络，无法利用检测器模型更优越的计数能力，因为检测器的枚举计数本质是不可微的。

Method: 设计自定义激活函数将检测器logits转换为软二进制指示器，在推理时优化预训练T2I模型的噪声先验。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升对象计数准确率（如D2D-Small基准提升13.7%），图像质量和计算开销影响很小。

Conclusion: D2D框架成功克服了检测器不可微的限制，有效提升了文本到图像生成模型的计数能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled

privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data
in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and
99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant
state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior
accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications
in early Alzheimer disease detection.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型虽然取得了显著进展，但其大规模特性在资源受限环境中不实用，需要开发高效的训练算法来创建强大且轻量级的VLMs。

Conclusion: 统一的强化和模仿学习策略能够有效提升轻量级学生模型的性能，使其能够与领先的闭源VLMs竞争。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，通过同时预测水深和海底分类，利用任务间交互提升浅水环境测绘精度，相比单任务方法显著降低RMSE并提高分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将水深估计和海底分类作为独立任务处理，忽略了它们之间的相互促进作用，限制了深度学习方法在浅水环境测绘中的广泛应用。

Method: 采用双分支编码器分别处理水深估计和像素级海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和窗口式Swin-Transformer融合块整合跨任务特征，并使用动态任务不确定性加权平衡目标。

Result: 在两个异质海岸站点评估中，相比传统经验模型和机器学习回归方法，RMSE降低达75%；相比最先进的单任务和多任务基线，水深RMSE降低10-30%，海底分类准确率提高达8%。

Conclusion: 联合建模水深与海底底质和栖息地可获得协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供了稳健的开放解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，通过将fMRI信号与CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，无需使用VAE管道即可实现高质量的图像解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将fMRI映射到CLIP的最终语义层，并添加参数密集的VAE管道来捕捉细节，但忽略了CLIP中间层的丰富物体信息，且不符合大脑的功能层次结构。

Method: 基于人类视觉系统的功能层次结构，将fMRI信号从不同视觉区域（低/高级）对齐到相应的CLIP中间层和最终层，引入交叉重建策略和多粒度损失函数。

Result: 在高级语义指标上达到或超越最先进方法，包括使用VAE管道的方法，同时参数量减少71.7%，有效捕捉了CLIP-only方法常遗漏的视觉细节。

Conclusion: 通过利用CLIP中间特征，BrainMCLIP在语义准确性和细节保真度之间取得了良好平衡，无需单独的VAE管道。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在无需训练的情况下实现有效、灵活和可泛化的开集词汇图像分割与识别的能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法忽视正则化的重要性，导致配准结果缺乏鲁棒性和解剖学合理性

Method: 基于变形场梯度范数动态调整弹性正则化，集成应变和剪切能项，包含折叠预防机制惩罚负雅可比区域

Result: 减轻非物理伪影如折叠，避免过度平滑，提高配准精度和解剖学合理性

Conclusion: DARE框架在医学图像配准中实现了更好的稳定性和解剖学合理性平衡

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

TL;DR: AegisRF是一个保护NeRF模型知识产权的框架，通过注入对抗性扰动来破坏未经授权的使用，同时使用敏感性场来保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NeRF成为3D场景表示和视图合成的强大工具，保护其知识产权免受未经授权使用变得越来越重要。

Method: 提出AegisRF框架，包含扰动场（注入对抗性扰动）和敏感性场（学习空间变化的几何扰动敏感性），自适应约束几何扰动以保持渲染质量。

Result: 实验证明AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态中具有通用适用性，包括多视图图像分类和基于体素的3D定位，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF有效保护了NeRF模型的知识产权，在破坏未经授权使用的同时保持了渲染质量，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

Motivation: 当前VLM评估主要关注单视角设置，而多摄像头在机器人平台中越来越普遍，但VLM能否有效利用多视角输入进行机器人推理仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 构建包含1.7k手动标注QA项的基准，涵盖8个子任务，分为空间理解和机器人执行两大类，评估了开源和闭源VLM模型。

Result: 最先进模型表现远低于人类水平，发现空间智能与机器人任务执行在多视角场景中正相关，且单视角基准的强表现不能可靠转化为机器人空间任务的成功。

Conclusion: VLM在多视角机器人感知中面临重大挑战，发布MV-RoboBench作为开放资源以促进空间基础VLM和VLA的发展。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

Result: 模型在所有地层中实现了出色的孔隙度控制(R^2=0.95)，平均绝对误差0.0099-0.0197。生成的图像显示出优越的代表性，双约束误差为1.9-11.3%，而随机提取的真实子图像为36.4-578%。

Conclusion: 该能力为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳储存、地热能源和地下水管理应用，其中了解孔隙空间的代表性形态对于实施数字岩石物理至关重要。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MRI加速范式，从图像重建转向预测性成像，通过生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，显著提升高倍加速下的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI采集时间过长限制了临床吞吐量，需要新的方法来加速MRI扫描过程。

Method: 使用生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，然后基于该先验重建高度欠采样的数据。模型可以基于多种数据源进行条件预测，包括其他对比度图像、历史扫描图像、采集参数和患者信息。

Result: 在内部和多个公共数据集（总计14,921次扫描；1,051,904个切片）上评估，包括多通道k空间数据，在多种高加速因子（x4、x8和x12）下，该方法显著优于其他方法，包括使用替代先验或无先验的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了从图像重建到预测性成像的根本性转变，为MRI加速提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRGCN是一种新颖的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过跨序列模式重用和记忆驱动的图卷积来解决深度模糊问题，在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频方法仅处理孤立序列，未能利用跨序列中普遍存在的结构规律性和重复运动模式，限制了3D姿态估计的性能提升。

Method: 提出模式重用图卷积网络(PRGCN)，包含图记忆库学习紧凑姿态原型，通过注意力机制动态检索并提供结构化先验，结合双流混合架构融合Mamba状态空间模型和自注意力的优势。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准测试中分别达到37.1mm和13.4mm的MPJPE，展现了增强的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨序列模式重用机制对推动该领域发展至关重要，将范式从每序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

*Julia Wąsala,Joannes D. Maasakkers,Ilse Aben,Rochelle Schneider,Holger Hoos,Mitra Baratchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，特别是在甲烷羽流检测中，模型会将标签与图像覆盖率关联，导致在低覆盖率图像中检测性能下降。作者评估了多种插补方法，并提出加权重采样方案来消除这种关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像通常存在系统性缺失像素（如云层遮挡），如果不处理这些缺失数据，会导致自动化特征提取模型出现表示偏差。在甲烷羽流检测中，标签与缺失值数量之间的虚假关联会使模型将图像覆盖率与标签关联，从而在低覆盖率图像中检测性能下降。

Method: 评估了多种插补方法以消除覆盖率与标签之间的依赖关系，并提出了一种加权重采样方案，通过在训练期间强制每个覆盖率区间内的类别平衡来消除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 重采样和插补都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不会损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。在操作场景中评估表明，经过去偏处理的模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的几率更高。

Conclusion: 通过重采样和插补技术可以有效减少卫星图像中的表示偏差，提高模型在低覆盖率图像中的检测性能，这对于实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

TL;DR: 提出了Cauvis方法解决单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关性问题，通过交叉注意力提示和双分支适配器分离因果-伪特征，在SDGOD数据集上取得15.9-31.4%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流方法通过数据增强缓解域差异，但由于域偏移和有限域知识，模型容易陷入伪相关陷阱，过度依赖简单分类特征而非本质的域不变表示。

Method: 提出Cauvis方法：1）交叉注意力提示模块，通过视觉提示与交叉注意力集成减轻伪特征偏差；2）双分支适配器，分离因果-伪特征并通过高频特征提取实现域适应。

Result: 在SDGOD数据集上，Cauvis相比现有域泛化方法获得15.9-31.4%的性能提升，在复杂干扰环境中表现出显著鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效解决了单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关性问题，通过因果-伪特征分离和域适应机制实现了优越的泛化性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

TL;DR: CARES是一个轻量级预处理模块，通过预测图像-查询对所需的最小分辨率来减少视觉语言模型的计算开销，在保持性能的同时将计算量减少高达80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致视觉token占总token的97-99%，造成高计算成本和延迟，即使低分辨率图像已足够完成任务。

Method: 使用紧凑VLM（350M）提取特征并预测目标预训练VLM响应收敛到峰值能力所需的最小分辨率，训练为离散分类器但推理时可插值连续分辨率进行细粒度控制。

Result: 在五个多模态基准测试中，CARES在保持任务性能的同时，将计算量减少了高达80%。

Conclusion: CARES通过智能选择最小足够分辨率，有效解决了视觉语言模型计算效率低的问题，在多种任务和模型上都表现出色。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

TL;DR: 提出PoseCrafter方法，通过混合视频生成和特征匹配选择器，解决稀疏重叠图像对的相机姿态估计问题，特别针对小重叠或无重叠情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理小重叠或无重叠图像对时表现不佳，视频插值生成的中间帧模糊且选择策略效率低，需要更清晰的中间帧生成和专门针对姿态估计的帧选择方法。

Method: 提出混合视频生成(HVG)，结合视频插值模型和姿态条件新视角合成模型生成清晰中间帧；设计基于特征匹配的选择器(FMS)从合成结果中选择适合姿态估计的帧。

Result: 在Cambridge Landmarks、ScanNet、DL3DV-10K和NAVI数据集上的实验表明，相比现有SOTA方法，PoseCrafter显著提升了姿态估计性能，特别是在小重叠或无重叠样本上。

Conclusion: PoseCrafter通过混合视频生成和特征匹配选择器，有效解决了稀疏重叠图像对的相机姿态估计挑战，在小重叠和无重叠情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉推理方面存在多个限制，包括识别关系、理解时间序列和计数物体等困难。本文旨在超越基准评估，深入探究模型失败的根本原因并改进其推理能力。

Method: 在受控实验条件下研究7个最先进视觉语言模型的计数能力，进行分层分析，并针对性地仅微调输出层。

Result: 实验显示视觉语言模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感。分层分析表明错误源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射问题。仅微调输出层可将准确率提升高达21%，并在真实数据集上获得一致改进。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的计数错误主要源于输出映射问题，通过针对性地微调输出层可以显著提升模型性能，这为改进视觉语言模型的推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Motivation: 虽然文本到图像模型能生成大量合成数据，但提示词复杂度对这些数据关键效用指标（质量、多样性、一致性）的系统性影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 首先进行合成实验验证提示词复杂度泛化的难度，然后提出新的评估框架比较真实数据和合成数据的效用，在多个数据集上分析提示词复杂度的影响。

Result: 增加提示词复杂度导致条件多样性和提示一致性降低，但减少分布偏移。提示扩展方法在图像多样性和美学方面表现最佳，甚至超过真实数据。

Conclusion: 提示词复杂度对合成数据效用有显著影响，当前推理时干预方法能在牺牲真实数据支持的情况下增强多样性，其中提示扩展方法表现最优。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势（RGB提供高空间分辨率和纹理细节，事件相机提供高时间分辨率和动态范围），但两者成像机制不同导致显著的时空不对称，阻碍了有效的多模态融合。

Method: 提出分层不对称蒸馏（HAD）框架，通过分层对齐策略显式建模和缓解时空不对称，在保持学生网络计算效率和参数紧凑性的同时最小化信息损失。

Result: 大量实验表明HAD在目标跟踪任务中持续优于最先进方法，全面的消融研究验证了每个设计组件的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: HAD框架成功解决了RGB和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，为多模态目标跟踪提供了有效的解决方案，代码即将发布。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 随着物体检测模型在自动驾驶汽车和监控平台等网络物理系统中的部署日益增多，确保其对抗威胁的安全性至关重要。现有研究主要探索图像域的对抗攻击，而视频域的攻击，特别是在无盒设置下的攻击，仍未被充分研究。

Method: 利用RGBA视频的alpha通道将恶意目标视频与良性视频融合，设计融合算法确保视觉隐蔽性和兼容性，无需访问模型架构、参数或输出。

Result: 在五个最先进的物体检测器、一个视觉语言模型和一个多模态大语言模型（Gemini-2.0-Flash）上评估，在所有场景中实现了100%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频感知系统中一个先前未被探索的漏洞，强调了在对抗环境中考虑alpha通道的防御措施的紧迫需求。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Method: 使用轻量级VGGT变体提取几何先验，设计高斯头融合多尺度几何token预测高斯参数，并通过特征一致性学习联合优化语义细化模型。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上显著优于现有方法，验证了VGD的可扩展性和高保真环绕视角重建能力。

Conclusion: VGD框架通过显式几何学习和特征一致性优化，成功解决了环绕视角场景重建中的质量与一致性平衡问题。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法在解决复杂多焦点图像融合挑战方面迈出重要一步，代码和权重已公开。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DecAF方法，通过分解注意力融合机制将MLLM的注意力图转换为分割掩码，无需训练即可实现视频推理分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面表现出色，但原始注意力图存在噪声且与物体区域对齐不佳，需要一种无需训练的方法来精炼这些注意力图以实现定位。

Method: 使用Decomposed Attention Fusion（DecAF）方法，包含对比性物体-背景融合和互补视频帧融合两个机制，结合注意力引导的SAM2提示来获得精细分割掩码。

Result: DecAF在引用和推理视频对象分割基准测试中优于无需训练的方法，性能与基于训练的方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需重新训练MLLM的有效视频分割解决方案，通过注意力图精炼实现了高质量的分割结果。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出CBDiff模型，通过生成多个多样化的伪造定位图来增强图像伪造定位的可信度，采用伯努利噪声和时序交叉注意力机制，在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法通常生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏高精度和可靠性，无法满足法医分析和安全监控等高风险应用的需求。

Method: 提出条件伯努利扩散模型(CBDiff)，生成多个多样化定位图；引入伯努利噪声反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性；设计时序交叉注意力(TSCAttention)利用语义特征和时间步长改进检测。

Result: 在8个公开基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多个可信定位图有效处理伪造区域的不确定性，展现出实际部署的强大潜力。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性基准XBench，用于评估胸片中的跨模态可解释性，发现当前视觉语言模型在医学图像中的定位能力存在不足，特别是对于小型或弥散性病变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中表现出色，但其定位能力（文本概念与视觉证据的对齐程度）尚未充分探索。在医学领域，可靠的定位对于可解释性和临床采用至关重要。

Method: 使用七种CLIP风格的视觉语言模型变体，通过交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并定量评估其与放射科医生标注区域的对应关系。

Result: 研究发现：(1)所有模型变体对大型明确病变定位良好，但对小型或弥散性病变性能显著下降；(2)在胸片特定数据集上预训练的模型比对通用数据训练的模型具有更好的对齐性；(3)模型的整体识别能力与定位能力强相关。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型尽管识别能力强，但在临床可靠的定位方面仍有不足，强调在医学实践中部署前需要进行有针对性的可解释性基准测试。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于散射系数的去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来抑制高斯噪声，在卡通图像去噪中达到了极小极大渐近界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的稀疏估计器在帧中无法充分适应复杂信号规律性，特别是对于边缘为分段C^α曲线的卡通图像，当Lipschitz指数α≤2时，小波、曲波等帧都是次优的。

Method: 引入散射系数作为简化的卷积神经网络模型，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来构建去噪估计器。

Result: 数值实验表明该去噪估计器对于所有Lipschitz指数α≤2的卡通图像都达到了极小极大渐近界。

Conclusion: 该方法为抑制信号噪声和指定函数几何规律性提供了不同的调和分析方法，并在调和分析与深度卷积网络去噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

Conclusion: GenComm提供了一种高效、可扩展的异构多智能体协作解决方案，显著降低了计算成本并保持了语义一致性。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有时刻检索方法面临的三个关键问题：数据稀缺导致模型陷入浅层关键词特征关联、相邻事件间边界模糊、以及细粒度语义区分不足。

Method: 提出AMR框架，包含两阶段训练：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义感知；蒸馏阶段引入双查询集（原始查询和主动查询），通过跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AMR相比之前的最先进方法实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: AMR框架能够在不依赖外部数据的情况下有效解决时刻检索中的边界模糊和语义混淆问题，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能，同时保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过强调全局定位和疾病特定细节，有效提升了医学诊断性能，且无需昂贵的人工标注。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

TL;DR: ReAct-GS通过重要性感知的致密化准则和参数扰动重新激活机制，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的过重建伪影问题，在复杂场景中实现了更好的新视图合成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在复杂场景中会出现过重建伪影，表现为局部模糊和针状扭曲。现有方法归因于大规模高斯分布分裂不足，但作者发现两个根本限制：致密化过程中的梯度幅度稀释和原始冻结现象。

Method: 提出ReAct-GS方法，包含：(1)重要性感知致密化准则，整合多视角α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域停滞的原始增长；(2)重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的原始分布。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重建伪影，在标准新视图合成指标上达到最先进性能，同时保留了精细几何细节。重新激活机制在其他3D-GS变体中也带来一致改进。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS通过重新激活机制成功解决了3D高斯泼溅中的过重建问题，展示了在复杂场景中的优越性能，并且该机制具有良好的通用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无配对图像翻译方法在医学成像中会扭曲细长的曲线结构（如微血管），影响诊断可靠性和定量分析，这在眼科和血管成像中尤为重要。

Method: CST框架通过添加曲线结构提取模块来提供拓扑监督，可无缝集成到现有方法中，已在CycleGAN和UNSB两个代表性骨干网络上实现。

Result: 在光学相干断层扫描血管成像、彩色眼底和X射线冠状动脉造影三种成像模态上的综合评估表明，CST提高了翻译保真度并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CST通过增强学习映射中的几何完整性，为医学成像中的曲线结构感知跨域翻译建立了原则性途径。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ensemble-CAM的新技术，为基于深度学习的面部呈现攻击检测系统提供视觉解释，以提高系统的透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型在呈现攻击检测中虽然有效，但大多作为黑盒运行，决策过程不透明。需要视觉解释技术来理解系统为何将生物特征图像判定为真实或伪造。

Method: 提出Ensemble-CAM技术，通过集成方法为深度学习面部PAD系统生成视觉解释，突出显示影响决策的关键区域。

Result: 该方法能够提供详细的视觉解释，帮助用户理解深度学习面部PAD系统的决策过程。

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM技术能够增强基于深度学习的面部呈现攻击检测系统的透明度和可信度，为理解模型行为提供更好的工具。

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，通过时空注意力机制和稳定性约束从高维视频中提取可解释的动态系统变量，有效抑制视觉干扰因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取真实动态变量具有挑战性，因为存在背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等干扰视觉因素。

Method: 第一阶段使用时序变换器自编码器通过全局注意力聚焦动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关分析选择物理意义维度，并使用Lyapunov稳定性正则化器优化转移动态。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验表明，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动保持不变性，并在CNN和纯变换器基线中实现最低分析均方误差。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力与稳定性约束可以产生既准确又物理可解释的预测模型。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

TL;DR: 提出ADQ自适应分布感知量化框架，通过自适应权重量化方案解决激活值分布不均和权重量化码本不匹配问题，在ImageNet上仅用2.81位平均位宽实现ResNet-18的71.512% Top-1准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化感知训练方法面临两个主要挑战：激活值的高度非均匀分布和权重量化中使用的静态不匹配码本。

Method: 提出自适应分布感知量化(ADQ)框架，包含三个关键创新：基于分位数的码本初始化、基于指数移动平均的在线码本自适应机制、以及基于敏感度的混合精度分配策略。对于激活值，集成硬件友好的非均匀到均匀映射方案。

Result: 在ImageNet上，ADQ使ResNet-18仅用2.81位平均位宽达到71.512% Top-1准确率，在可比条件下优于最先进方法。在CIFAR-10上的消融研究系统验证了各创新组件的贡献。

Conclusion: ADQ框架通过自适应权重量化方案有效解决了量化感知训练中的分布不均和码本不匹配问题，在低比特量化下实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X是一个多功能多模态人体运动生成框架，采用自回归扩散变换器统一处理多种任务，包括文本到运动、音乐到舞蹈、语音到手势等，并支持时空控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态人体运动生成中内容一致性、风格保持和时间动态控制的问题，同时处理多模态任务间的冲突，构建一个统一的框架。

Method: 提出使用参考运动作为条件信号，采用渐进式弱到强混合条件训练策略处理多模态冲突，并构建了最大的多模态运动数据集OmniMoCap-X。

Result: 实验证明OmniMotion-X在多个多模态任务上显著超越现有方法，实现了最先进的性能，能够生成真实、连贯且可控的长时运动。

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X通过统一的序列到序列框架和创新的训练策略，在多模态人体运动生成任务中表现出色，为交互式长时运动生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练分布与部署分布不一致时性能下降，现有测试时适应方法忽略了长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类之间的混淆问题

Method: CPL-NC包含类感知原型缓存模块（动态调整每类容量并包含激活机制）和负对比学习机制（识别并约束困难视觉-文本负样本），采用非对称优化策略仅更新文本原型

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CPL-NC在ResNet-50和ViT-B/16骨干网络上均优于现有测试时适应方法

Conclusion: CPL-NC是一个轻量级的测试时适应框架，能有效提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在文本引导图像编辑方面取得了显著进展，但研究社区受到缺乏基于真实图像构建的大规模、高质量、开放可访问数据集的限制。

Method: 利用Nano-Banana从OpenImages集合的真实照片生成多样化的编辑对，采用细粒度图像编辑分类法确保编辑类型的全面覆盖，通过基于MLLM的质量评分和精心策划来保持精确的内容保留和指令忠实度。

Result: 构建了包含40万张图像的Pico-Banana-400K数据集，包含三个专门子集：7.2万示例的多轮编辑集合、5.6万示例的偏好子集，以及配对的短长编辑指令。

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为训练和基准测试下一代文本引导图像编辑模型建立了坚实基础，推动了复杂编辑场景的研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided

Motivation: 单目深度估计领域缺乏标准化的评估方法，现有指标的选择多样且其权衡和行为未被充分理解，需要系统分析指标性能并与人类判断对齐。

Method: 对现有指标进行定量分析，测试它们对地面真值各种扰动的敏感性，特别关注与人类判断的比较，并引入基于相对表面法向的新指标。

Result: 分析显示现有指标对曲率扰动（如使平坦表面变波浪形）严重不敏感，新提出的相对表面法向指标能更好捕捉这类误差。

Conclusion: 需要新的评估指标来更好反映深度估计质量，提出的相对表面法向指标和复合指标构建方法能改善与人类判断的对齐度。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and
diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our
videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in
current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking
methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架来分析测试时缩放中验证器的作用，将可验证测试时缩放建模为传输问题，揭示了次优性-覆盖率曲线的三个区域，并分析了顺序和批量采样算法的计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管测试时缩放与验证在提升大语言模型性能方面显示出潜力，但验证器的作用及其不完善性仍未得到充分探索。现有研究只捕捉了这些因素的部分子集，缺乏量化它们相互作用几何结构的统一框架。

Method: 将可验证测试时缩放构建为传输问题，通过分析生成器的覆盖率、验证器的收敛区域和采样算法的次优性之间的相互作用，提出了顺序和批量两类采样算法。

Result: 理论分析揭示了次优性-覆盖率曲线存在三个区域：传输区域（次优性随覆盖率增加）、策略改进区域（次优性可能随覆盖率减少，取决于验证器的收敛区域）和饱和区域（次优性趋于稳定）。实证结果与Qwen、Llama和Gemma模型一致。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一个统一框架来理解验证器在测试时缩放中的作用，揭示了覆盖率、验证器性能和采样算法之间的复杂相互作用，为设计更有效的测试时缩放策略提供了理论基础。

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习诊断方法依赖静态数据集，无法模拟临床医生在实践中的顺序性、资源感知推理。诊断在高压或资源有限环境中仍然复杂且容易出错，需要能够帮助临床医生做出及时且成本效益高的决策的框架。

Method: 将贝叶斯实验设计与大型语言模型集成，LLMs作为灵活模拟器生成合理的患者状态分布并支持信念更新，无需结构化、任务特定的训练数据。临床医生可以参与整个过程，审查测试建议、解释中间输出并应用临床判断。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的评估显示，ACTMED能够优化测试选择，提高诊断准确性、可解释性和资源使用效率。

Conclusion: 这是朝着透明、自适应且与临床医生对齐的诊断系统迈出的一步，能够在减少对领域特定数据依赖的情况下跨环境泛化。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

Motivation: 基于人类反馈的奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击和泛化能力差的问题，模型会利用训练数据中的虚假特征（如回答冗长、讨好语气等）来获取高分，而不是真正反映人类意图

Method: 受核视角不变理论启发，提出PRISM方法，通过闭式学习目标学习具有特征映射的群不变核，缓解奖励学习中的捷径行为

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法一致提高了奖励模型在多样化分布外任务上的准确性，并减少了下游策略模型对捷径的依赖

Conclusion: PRISM为基于偏好的对齐建立了一个稳健框架，能有效缓解奖励模型中的捷径行为问题

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

Method: 开发了MUSE Benchmark，包含10个任务来探测基础音乐感知技能，评估了4个SOTA模型并与200人的人类基线对比。

Conclusion: MUSE Benchmark为评估不变音乐表示提供了关键工具，将推动开发更鲁棒的AI系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型在临床试验报告CONSORT标准评估中的表现，发现不同模型和提示条件下存在显著差异，揭示了当前系统在临床合规自动化中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在医疗领域快速扩展，但其按照CONSORT标准评估临床试验报告的能力仍不明确，特别是在认知和推理策略方面。

Method: 采用行为和元认知分析方法，使用专家验证数据，系统比较两个代表性LLM在三种提示条件下的表现。

Result: 模型在处理不同CONSORT项目和提示类型时存在明显差异，推理风格、明确不确定性和替代解释等因素影响了响应模式。

Conclusion: 结果强调了当前系统在临床合规自动化中的局限性，并指出理解其认知适应和策略行为对于开发更可解释和可靠的医疗AI的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

### [81] [The Zero-Step Thinking: An Empirical Study of Mode Selection as Harder Early Exit in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19176)
*Yuqiao Tan,Shizhu He,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了推理模型中的模式选择问题，将其识别为早期退出问题的更具挑战性变体，并评估了现有方法在零步思维场景下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但逐步思考过程常导致过度思考，产生不必要的计算开销。模式选择和早期退出方法旨在减少这种计算负担。

Method: 通过实证研究比较了九种基线方法，包括基于提示的方法和利用模型内部信息的方法，在零步思维场景下评估模式选择性能。

Result: 基于提示的方法由于分类能力有限而经常失败，而利用内部信息的方法在大多数场景中表现更好但仍存在稳定性问题。现有方法在信息有限的情况下不足以有效解决模式选择问题。

Conclusion: 模式选择是比早期退出更具挑战性的问题，现有方法在零步思维场景下仍面临困难，突显了该任务的持续挑战性。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebGraphEval是一个将多个智能体的网页交互轨迹抽象为统一加权动作图的框架，用于更全面地评估网页智能体，超越传统的二元成功指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页智能体评估主要依赖二元成功指标或单一参考轨迹，忽略了基准数据集中存在的结构多样性。

Method: 将多个智能体的轨迹抽象为统一的加权动作图，支持规范动作编码、合并重复行为，并应用结构分析包括奖励传播和成功加权边统计。

Result: 在来自六个网页智能体的数千条轨迹上的评估显示，图抽象能够捕捉跨模型规律性、突出冗余和低效行为，并识别被结果指标忽视的关键决策点。

Conclusion: 通过将网页交互构建为图结构数据，WebGraphEval为网页智能体建立了多路径、跨智能体和效率感知评估的通用方法。

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

*Marianna Molinari,Ilaria Angela Amantea,Marinella Quaranta,Guido Governatori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过法律领域实验评估ChatGPT性能，发现即使具备相关知识能力，ChatGPT也无法整合推理得出全面结果，揭示了其在复杂问题分解和综合解决方面的重大局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估ChatGPT在法律领域的实际表现，特别是与基于正则表达式的基线方法对比，而非仅与人类表现比较，以揭示其真正的能力局限。

Method: 采用法律领域实验，将ChatGPT与基于正则表达式(Regex)的基线方法进行性能对比，分析其在法律决策文本中提取法律原则关键段落的能力。

Result: ChatGPT即使拥有必要的知识和能力，也无法有效整合这些能力进行推理，无法提供全面统一的结果，在法律文本分析任务中表现存在根本性局限。

Conclusion: 真正的智能需要分解复杂问题并基于多种能力提供统一全面解决方案的能力，这在法律领域仍然是人类独有的特质，人工智能目前缺乏这种全面理解和推理能力。

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了推导状态论证框架(DSA-framework)，为容纳不一致先例的广义理由模型提供论证性解释方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于先例的推理假设先例集合必须一致，但广义理由模型放松了这一假设。目前缺乏针对这种广义推理框架的论证性解释方法。

Method: 扩展推导状态论证框架(DSA-framework)，使其能够解释基于广义理由模型的推理过程。

Result: 开发了能够处理不一致先例的论证性解释框架，填补了广义理由模型缺乏相应解释方法的空白。

Conclusion: 扩展的DSA框架为广义理由模型提供了有效的论证性解释方法，支持在不一致先例情况下的推理解释。

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多智能体LLM模拟框架，通过行为奖励函数和情境学习来研究LLM智能体是否能重现人类在线社交动态，包括同质性、互惠性和社会验证等特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型智能体是否能重现人类在线社交的复杂动态，以及哪些记忆和学习机制能促使这种动态出现。

Method: 设计了一个多智能体LLM模拟框架，智能体通过重复互动、相互评估和行为适应，结合行为奖励函数（捕捉社交互动、信息寻求、自我展示、协调和情感支持等核心驱动因素）和情境学习加速机制。

Result: 实验表明，经过指导的LLM智能体能够发展出稳定的互动模式并形成涌现的社交联系，产生的网络结构反映了真实在线社区的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LLM群体中的集体动态建立了一个原则性测试平台，揭示了人工智能体如何近似或偏离类人社交行为。

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了CKA-RL方法，通过持续知识适应策略和自适应知识合并机制，解决持续强化学习中的灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境通常是非平稳的，需要智能体持续适应新任务和变化条件。现有持续强化学习方法存在灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题。

Method: 提出持续知识适应策略，维护任务特定知识向量池，动态使用历史知识适应新任务；引入自适应知识合并机制，合并相似知识向量以减少内存需求。

Result: 在三个基准测试上优于最先进方法，整体性能提升4.20%，前向迁移提升8.02%。

Conclusion: CKA-RL通过知识积累和有效利用，成功缓解了灾难性遗忘，实现了跨任务的高效知识迁移。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at
https://github.com/snooow1029/MSC_Bench.

*Wonje Choi,Jooyoung Kim,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeSyPr是一个新颖的具身推理框架，通过神经符号程序化将知识编译为可组合的过程表示，使语言模型代理能够在动态环境中进行结构化、自适应和及时的推理，而无需依赖外部符号规划器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态环境中采用语言模型进行具身任务时面临的挑战，包括延迟、连接性和资源限制，这些限制使得在线访问大规模推理引擎或符号规划器变得困难。

Method: 首先使用符号工具生成任务特定计划，然后将这些计划转换为编码计划隐含生产规则的可组合过程表示，最后将这些组合过程无缝集成到语言模型的推理过程中。

Result: 在PDDLGym、VirtualHome和ALFWorld等具身基准测试中，NeSyPr展示了比大规模推理模型和符号规划器更高效的推理能力，同时使用更紧凑的语言模型。

Conclusion: 神经符号程序化将多步符号结构化路径查找和推理抽象并泛化为单步语言模型推理，类似于人类知识编译，适合在延迟敏感和资源受限的物理系统中部署。

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

TL;DR: 提出DAIL方法解决语言指令的歧义性问题，通过分布策略和语义对齐提升智能体对自然语言指令的理解和执行能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指令的灵活性导致任务间存在显著歧义，严重影响算法性能，需要解决语言条件任务中的指令模糊性问题

Method: DAIL方法包含两个核心组件：分布策略（通过值分布估计机制增强任务可区分性）和语义对齐模块（捕捉轨迹与语言指令的对应关系）

Result: 在结构化和视觉观察基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DAIL能有效解决指令歧义，性能优于基线方法

Conclusion: DAIL通过分布对齐学习成功解决了语言指令的歧义性问题，为智能体理解人类指令提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp是首个评估深度搜索代理在分层规则应用能力的电商基准测试，要求代理根据商品描述预测10位HS编码，结果显示当前最佳代理准确率仅46.8%，远低于人类专家的95.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试忽视了深度搜索代理应用复杂规则（如法律条款、医疗手册和关税规则）的关键能力，这些规则具有模糊边界和隐含逻辑关系，应用难度大。

Method: 从大型电商平台收集真实数据构建HSCodeComp基准，包含632个产品条目，涵盖多样化产品类别，HS编码由多位人类专家标注。

Result: 在多个最先进LLM、开源和闭源代理上的实验结果显示巨大性能差距：最佳代理仅达到46.8%的10位准确率，远低于人类专家的95.0%，测试时扩展也无法进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 分层规则应用对当前代理具有挑战性，HSCodeComp基准揭示了深度搜索代理在复杂规则应用方面的显著不足，需要进一步研究提升这方面的能力。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有城市感知系统在多样化城市场景中泛化能力有限，决策过程缺乏可解释性，需要开发更适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好的解决方案。

Method: 结合经典规划器生成基线解决方案，通过多智能体进化系统迭代优化，使感知任务分配适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好，同时生成自然语言解释。

Result: 在两个大规模移动数据集和七种动态干扰上的实验表明，AgentSense在适应性和可解释性方面优于传统方法，相比单智能体LLM基线在性能和鲁棒性上表现更优。

Conclusion: AgentSense代表了向部署自适应和可解释城市感知系统的重要进展，在Web环境中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

Motivation: 和弦音独奏是爵士吉他即兴演奏的基础技能，但学习和练习难度较大，需要系统化的工具辅助。

Method: 1. 生成和弦音琶音；2. 构建加权图（节点代表和弦琶音）；3. 计算相邻和弦节点间的最优过渡音权重；4. 寻找图中最短路径；5. 重构和弦音独奏线。

Result: 成功开发了一个用户友好的系统，能够为吉他学生提供有效的和弦音独奏练习建议。

Conclusion: 该基于图论的引擎为吉他学生提供了系统化的和弦音独奏练习工具，有助于提高即兴演奏能力。

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

Motivation: 电子竞技观众和玩家数量增长，加上通信技术和云计算发展，推动了在线游戏产业发展。传统AI解决方案主要关注批量分类，忽略了流式处理和可视化技术。

Method: 采用可解释的胜率预测分类方法，通过多个滑动窗口控制输入数据，以反映游戏中的相关变化。

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE是一个将大语言模型与概率建模相结合的统一框架，用于学习加权规则集，通过规则生成、逻辑回归、迭代优化和评估四个阶段实现更可靠的神经符号推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法忽略了规则间的交互作用，且未充分利用LLM与概率规则学习的结合潜力，需要开发能够进行鲁棒推理的统一框架。

Method: RLIE包含四个阶段：1) LLM生成和筛选候选规则；2) 逻辑回归学习概率权重进行全局选择和校准；3) 基于预测误差迭代优化规则集；4) 评估加权规则集作为直接分类器的性能。

Result: 使用学习权重的规则直接推理表现更优，而将规则、权重和逻辑模型输出注入LLM反而降低准确性，表明LLM擅长语义生成但概率整合能力较弱。

Conclusion: RLIE阐明了LLM在归纳推理中的潜力和局限性，通过与经典概率规则组合方法结合，实现了更可靠的神经符号推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Method: Memo通过在模型训练时输入中插入周期性总结标记来实现记忆的创建和检索，提供了一种计算和存储效率更高的解决方案。

Result: 在网格世界元强化学习基准和照片级真实室内环境的多目标导航任务中，Memo优于朴素的长上下文transformer基线，在推理时对更长上下文具有更好的泛化能力，并在流式设置中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Memo为embodied agent在长时间操作中有效形成和访问记忆提供了一种有效的transformer架构，解决了视觉输入超出上下文限制的问题。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准局限于局部上下文，无法测试跨来源和长时间跨度的推理能力，需要新的评估方法来衡量智能体的主动性。

Method: 设计PROBE基准，将主动性分解为三个核心能力管道，并应用于评估领先的LLM和流行智能体框架。

Result: 即使最先进的模型也难以解决该基准，GPT-5和Claude Opus-4.1的最佳端到端性能仅为40%，揭示了自主行动能力的局限性。

Conclusion: 结果突显了智能体系统中自主行动的当前局限性，并揭示了有前景的未来研究方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

Motivation: 当前学习世界模型的方法偏离了目标：训练和评估都锚定在下一帧预测上，成功标准是在同一环境中最大化奖励。需要一种更全面的评估协议。

Method: 提出了WorldTest协议，包含无奖励探索、派生测试和行为评分。实例化为AutumnBench，包含43个交互式网格世界环境和129个任务，涵盖掩码帧预测、规划和因果动力学变化预测三个类别。

Result: 比较了517名人类参与者和三个前沿模型，发现人类表现优于模型，计算规模扩大只在某些环境中提高性能。

Conclusion: WorldTest提供了一个评估智能体学习环境动态的新模板，AutumnBench揭示了世界模型学习中的显著改进空间。

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种与对抗性示例相反的构造方法，即创建与原始样本显著不同但模型输出相同的示例，并开发了NI-FGSM、NI-FGM等算法来生成此类对抗性示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗性示例是在原始样本附近添加微小扰动使模型输出错误结果，而本文探索相反方向：创建与原始样本显著不同但仍保持相同模型输出的示例，以揭示模型决策边界的更多特性。

Method: 提出了负迭代快速梯度符号方法(NI-FGSM)、负迭代快速梯度方法(NI-FGM)及其动量变体NMI-FGSM和NMI-FGM，这些算法通过迭代优化生成与原始样本差异最大化但模型输出不变的对抗性示例。

Result: 实验表明这类对抗性示例广泛分布在样本空间中，而不仅仅局限于原始样本的邻域，这揭示了模型决策边界的复杂性和对抗性示例的分布特性。

Conclusion: 对抗性示例不仅存在于原始样本的局部邻域，而是广泛分布于整个样本空间，这对理解机器学习模型的安全性和鲁棒性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的1D启发式或2D双变量权衡方法无法同时考虑成本、延迟和准确性约束，需要更全面的优化框架。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛模拟在三个代表性场景和九个模拟大语言模型上评估四种优化方法，解决3D多目标优化问题。

Result: 膝点优化实现了最佳平衡，当精度优先时准确性最大化方法仍然更优。该框架为不同操作环境下的部署感知推理扩展建立了理论基础。

Conclusion: 3D多目标优化框架能够捕捉1D和2D优化无法覆盖的可行空间，实现环境自适应的推理扩展参数选择。

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

Conclusion: 该基础模型具有促进当前神经影像在临床常规应用中发展的巨大潜力。

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

TL;DR: ADPO是一个统一框架，扩展了DPO，引入了软偏好概率、任意参考策略锚定和列表式偏好建模，在噪声环境下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO假设硬二元标签和成对比较，无法处理偏好不确定性、训练不稳定性和列表式偏好建模的需求。

Method: ADPO引入：(1)软偏好概率编码不确定性；(2)任意参考策略锚定提供稳定训练；(3)通过Plackett-Luce分布进行列表式偏好建模。

Result: 在上下文赌博机中，锚定使WinMass比标准DPO提升38-63%；在重尾噪声下，KDE平滑实现0.68 vs 0.32（112%相对增益）；在顺序强化学习中，锚定在噪声偏好下性能提升15-29%。

Conclusion: ADPO为不同噪声环境提供明确指导：清洁或中等噪声使用成对锚定Soft-DPO，极端污染使用基于KDE的列表式ADPO。

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

Method: 创建了MLX-transformers框架，包含不同的Transformer实现在MLX中，并将PyTorch模型检查点转换为MLX格式，在苹果硅设备上进行基准测试。

Result: 在苹果硅MacBook设备上对BERT、RoBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa模型进行推理延迟性能评估，并与NVIDIA CUDA GPU进行对比。

Conclusion: MLX在苹果生态系统内实现了高效且更易访问的设备端机器学习应用，展示了其在苹果硅设备上的潜力。

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

Conclusion: 将监督学习中的标签噪声校正与现代RLHF相结合，为噪声现实部署提供理论洞见和实用算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 提出的多尺度学习框架有效解决了复杂系统的建模和预测挑战，提供了所有时间尺度的近似和解释，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习在LLM对齐中面临策略熵急剧下降、优化不稳定甚至崩溃的挑战，主要由于负优势样本主导策略梯度以及固定裁剪机制阻碍熵增加更新。

Method: 提出BAPO方法，基于熵裁剪规则动态调整裁剪边界，自适应平衡正负贡献，保持策略熵并稳定RL优化。

Result: 在AIME 2024和2025基准测试中，7B BAPO模型超越SkyWork-OR1-7B等开源模型，32B BAPO模型在同规模模型中达到SOTA，甚至优于o3-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking等专有系统。

Conclusion: BAPO通过自适应裁剪机制有效解决了离线RL中的优化不平衡问题，实现了快速、稳定且数据高效的训练，在多个场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文指出许多深度神经网络的事后泛化度量是脆弱的，即使微小的训练修改也会显著改变度量值、趋势或缩放行为，建议新度量开发者应明确审计其脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管各种泛化度量被应用于深度神经网络，但现有度量往往被认为能够再现定性泛化趋势。本文旨在揭示这些事后度量的脆弱性问题。

Method: 通过实验分析不同训练修改（如超参数调整、SGD变体切换）对多种泛化度量的影响，包括路径范数、谱范数、Frobenius范数、平坦度代理和确定性PAC-Bayes代理等。

Result: 发现许多泛化度量对微小训练修改高度敏感，例如学习率调整可以逆转路径范数的学习曲线斜率。PAC-Bayes起源度量虽然对超参数调整较不敏感，但无法捕捉数据复杂度的差异。

Conclusion: 许多事后泛化度量存在脆弱性问题，新度量开发者需要明确审计其脆弱性，函数基础的边际似然PAC-Bayes边界虽然能捕捉数据复杂度差异，但不是事后度量。

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

TL;DR: NeuroAda是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过识别重要参数并引入旁路连接，在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法存在权衡：基于添加的方法（如LoRA）内存效率高但表示能力有限，而选择性原位适应方法能实现精确适应但内存消耗大。需要平衡这一权衡。

Method: 首先识别网络中的重要参数，然后为这些选定的参数引入旁路连接。在微调过程中只更新旁路连接，保持原始模型参数冻结。

Result: 在23+个自然语言生成和理解任务上的实验表明，NeuroAda仅需≤0.02%的可训练参数就能达到最先进性能，同时将CUDA内存使用减少高达60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda成功解决了PEFT方法在内存效率和细粒度适应能力之间的权衡问题，提供了一种高效且有效的微调解决方案。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Conclusion: 对抗性蒸馏框架有效解决了神经算子的分布外泛化问题，为PDE求解提供了既快速又鲁棒的解决方案

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的编码-分解范式用于时间序列异常检测，通过将编码表示分解为稳定和辅助表示来提高训练数据被污染时的鲁棒性，并使用基于互信息的新指标替代重构误差来识别异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自编码器方法在训练时间序列包含异常时，其学习到的表示对异常敏感，导致检测精度下降。需要一种更鲁棒的方法来处理训练数据被污染的情况。

Method: 采用编码-分解范式，将编码后的表示分解为稳定表示和辅助表示，并使用基于互信息的新指标来识别异常，而不是传统的重构误差。

Result: 在8个常用的多变量和单变量时间序列基准测试中表现出竞争性或最先进的性能，并对不同污染比例的时间序列展现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的编码-分解范式和基于互信息的异常检测指标能够有效提高时间序列异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性，特别是在训练数据包含异常的情况下。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

Motivation: 当前医疗实践依赖标准化治疗框架，忽视患者个体差异，导致次优健康结果。需要开发个性化医疗系统来克服这一局限。

Method: 使用LLM处理非结构化医疗文本（93.2%准确率），CTGAN生成合成患者数据（55%准确率），T-learner预测个体治疗反应（84.3%准确率），上下文bandit优化在线治疗选择。

Result: 在III期结肠癌数据集测试中，KernelUCB方法在5000轮中获得0.60-0.61平均奖励分数，优于其他参考方法。

Conclusion: 该系统克服了在线学习环境的冷启动限制，提高了计算效率，在个性化医疗方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to
suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks
(CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to
provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured
datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient
data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast
patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000
rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes
cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine
adapted to specific patient characteristics.

Conclusion: 结论是类别学习通过最大化互信息诱导了类别边界附近的神经表征扩展，该方法与信息瓶颈方法相关，并提供了贝叶斯成本的偏差-方差分解。

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策树依赖简单的轴对齐线性分割，需要深度复杂的结构来捕捉非线性特征效应，这削弱了人类对构建树的理解。

Method: 提出SGT，每个内部节点对单个特征应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数，实现丰富的非线性分割。开发了ShapeCART算法来学习SGT，并扩展到双变量形状函数(S²GT)和多路树(SGT_K)。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SGT相比传统轴对齐线性树实现了更优越的性能，同时减少了模型规模。

Conclusion: SGT通过引入可学习的形状函数，在保持决策树可解释性的同时，显著提升了模型性能和紧凑性。

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

TL;DR: POLAR是首个使用强化学习解决联邦学习中后门关键层选择问题的框架，通过轻量级伯努利采样和策略梯度更新，在保持隐蔽性的同时显著提升攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的分布式特性使其容易受到后门攻击，现有基于规则的后门关键层选择方法没有考虑层间相互关系，导致效果不佳且容易被先进防御检测。

Method: 提出POLAR框架，采用强化学习动态学习攻击策略，使用伯努利采样进行轻量化处理，基于后门成功率改进进行策略梯度更新，并引入正则化约束限制修改层数以保持隐蔽性。

Result: 实验表明POLAR在对抗六种最先进防御方法时，比最新攻击方法性能提升高达40%。

Conclusion: POLAR证明了强化学习在后门关键层选择问题中的有效性，能够实现高攻击成功率同时保持隐蔽性，为联邦学习安全研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

TL;DR: 研究发现Maximal Update Parameterization (muP)的学习率缩放规则仅在训练初期有效，在LLM训练等实际场景中，权重衰减才是稳定内部表示更新动态的关键因素，muP主要起到隐式学习率预热的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何将小神经网络的最优学习率有效迁移到大网络中，以解决超参数调优在大型模型训练中的高昂成本问题。

Method: 通过大规模实证研究，分析muP学习率缩放规则在实际训练中的有效性，特别关注权重衰减对内部表示更新动态的影响。

Result: muP的假设仅在训练初期成立，在LLM训练等实际场景中，权重衰减比muP更能稳定跨宽度模型的更新动态，muP主要起到学习率预热的作用。

Conclusion: 这些发现挑战了关于学习率迁移的现有认知，解释了为什么muP需要独立权重衰减变体才能成功实现迁移，并建议可以用改进的预热调度来替代muP。

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

TL;DR: 本文通过统一的离线评估框架，将课程难度分解为五个维度，研究了课程学习在大型语言模型推理中的效果。研究发现没有通用的最佳课程策略，前向与反向课程学习的相对效果取决于模型能力和任务复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程学习已成为提升大型语言模型推理能力的流行策略，但先前研究使用不同的难度指标和训练设置，导致对课程学习何时有效、哪种方向更好等基本问题缺乏统一认识。

Method: 采用统一的离线评估框架，将课程难度分解为五个互补维度：问题难度、模型惊奇度、置信度边际、预测不确定性和决策变异性。在数学推理基准上对Llama3.1-8B、Mistral-7B和Gemma3-4B进行受控后训练实验。

Result: 研究发现：(i)没有通用的主导课程策略，前向与反向课程学习的相对效果取决于模型能力和任务复杂度；(ii)即使在单一指标内，不同难度水平的样本根据任务需求产生不同的收益；(iii)任务对齐课程关注塑造模型的最终表示和泛化能力，而内部状态课程调节置信度和不确定性等内部状态。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了通用课程策略的概念，为不同模型和任务机制提供了可操作的指导，某些指标表明优先处理决策不确定样本可以进一步改善学习效果。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

TL;DR: MetaCluster框架通过元学习器和聚类技术，将KANs的参数存储量减少高达80倍，同时保持准确率不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs用向量权重替代标量权重提高了表达能力，但导致参数和内存呈倍数增长，需要压缩方法。

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器将系数向量映射到低维流形，然后进行K-means聚类，用共享质心替代每边向量，最后微调质心码本。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，标准KANs和ConvKANs的参数存储量减少了高达80倍，准确率无损失。

Conclusion: MetaCluster框架成功实现了KANs的高效压缩，利用参数向量特性跨多个系数分摊存储成本。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

Motivation: 在社交网络中，用户分享推荐的成功率高度依赖于上下文因素，准确估计这些影响力概率对于理解信息传播过程和改进病毒营销策略至关重要。然而，从数据中学习这些概率具有挑战性：静态数据只能捕捉相关性，而在线学习算法要么浪费资源进行随机探索，要么偏向探索影响力概率较高的空间。

Method: 采用上下文线性赌博机框架，提出了一种不确定性引导的探索算法，通过调整参数可以在遗憾最小化和估计误差之间实现任意权衡。

Result: 在半合成网络数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于静态方法和忽略这种权衡的上下文赌博机方法。

Conclusion: 论文成功解决了同伴影响力概率学习中的基本权衡问题，提出的算法能够灵活地在不同目标之间进行权衡，为信息传播和营销策略优化提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控音乐生成方法通常需要重新训练模型或会产生可听伪影，需要一种能够在不影响生成质量的前提下对冻结预训练模型进行精细控制的方法。

Method: 使用RFMs分析模型内部梯度来发现音乐概念方向，训练轻量级RFM探针发现MusicGen隐藏状态中的概念方向，在推理时将其注入回模型进行实时引导，支持动态时间变化调度和多重音乐属性同时控制。

Result: 能够将目标音符生成的准确率从0.23提升到0.82，同时文本提示的遵循度保持在未引导基线的约0.02范围内，在控制效果和生成质量之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: MusicRFM提供了一种无需重新训练即可对预训练音乐模型进行精细可控生成的有效方法，在保持提示保真度的同时显著提升了控制精度。

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

Motivation: 传统Granger因果性测试基于线性模型，难以检测非线性因果关系。现有非线性方法依赖两个关键假设：因果充分性和已知干预目标，但现实世界时间序列数据通常存在潜在混杂因素和异质性环境，没有干预的先验知识。

Method: 提出不变Granger因果性(InvarGC)，利用跨环境异质性来缓解潜在混杂因素的影响，在边缘级别粒度上区分干预和非干预环境，从而恢复不变的因果关系。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 建立了在这些条件下的可识别性，提出的InvarGC方法能够有效处理现实世界时间序列数据中的潜在混杂因素和环境异质性问题。

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型越来越多地在合成数据上进行微调，存在微妙错位通过互连AI系统传播的关键风险。虽然这种现象已被识别，但对其动态的定量理解仍然缺失。

Method: 使用GPT-2构建师生设置，系统研究潜藏污染的缩放规律、阈值和机制，包括行为交叉测试、相变分析和可解释性分析。

Result: 实验发现三个关键结果：(1)潜藏污染导致行为交叉，不仅退化目标特征，还降低模型整体对齐性；(2)对齐性在污染数据达到临界阈值时发生急剧相变，而非逐渐退化；(3)可解释性分析显示污染机制模仿模型的自然微调过程，难以检测。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了依赖合成数据的AI系统中的关键脆弱性，并强调了需要能够应对潜在威胁的新安全协议。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型微调中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是当下游领域数据有限或与预训练分布差异较大时。现有参数高效微调方法在权重空间操作，可能导致模型过度特化到下游数据，覆盖预训练知识。

Method: 在特征空间进行微调，提出LoRFA（低秩特征适应）和VeFA（基于向量的特征适应）。基于效应等价建模理论，将下游潜伏变量表示为对观测特征的总等效量，通过轻量级特征级变换补偿这些变量的影响。

Result: 在图像分类、自然语言理解和生成任务上评估，相比LoRA，特征空间适应方法在标准微调指标上表现相当，但在鲁棒性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 特征空间适应能有效保护预训练表示，提高模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力，为缓解灾难性遗忘提供了新思路。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对线性部分监测问题的非随机（对抗性）有限动作算法，通过探索优化方法实现高效实现，获得了比先前理论更透明的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性部分监测可以建模无限结果空间，同时在线性结构和观测上施加约束，作为线性bandits的推广，其中损失和反馈以灵活方式解耦。

Method: 使用探索优化方法的简单实例，适用于高效实现。该方法针对有限动作的非随机版本问题。

Result: 获得了依赖游戏结构的更透明遗憾界，包含反映观测与损失对齐程度的实例特定量，在易游戏中达到√T速率，在难游戏中达到T^{2/3}速率。

Conclusion: 该模型包含了新旧部分信息设置，在有趣情况下对游戏结构的依赖可以达到紧致。

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

Conclusion: 该模型将为跨学科研究人员提供支持，使他们能够整合多时间点和多环境下的行为特征，构建可用于复杂研究问题的综合数据集

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

Motivation: 尽管NGVI在实践中广泛使用且成功，但其理论基础有限，特别是在非共轭似然情况下，变分损失变得非凸且难以分析。

Method: 针对均值场参数化，推导变分损失满足相对平滑性的充分条件，提出包含非欧投影的改进NGVI算法，并在额外结构假设下揭示变分损失的隐藏凸性。

Conclusion: 这些结果为NGVI在挑战性推断设置中的几何性质和收敛行为提供了新的理论见解。

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

TL;DR: 论文发现多任务后训练中不同任务产生的梯度大小存在显著差异，大梯度任务并不一定带来更大的学习收益，这种梯度不平衡源于任务间的固有差异，需要梯度级别的修正方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多任务后训练假设所有任务贡献相似大小的梯度，但研究发现这个假设在RL后训练中不成立，某些任务会产生显著更大的梯度，导致优化偏向这些任务。

Method: 通过分析多任务后训练中不同任务的梯度大小和学习收益关系，研究梯度不平衡现象及其原因。

Result: 发现大梯度任务并不一定带来更大的学习收益，梯度不平衡不能通过训练奖励或优势等典型统计量解释，而是源于任务间的固有差异。

Conclusion: 需要避免简单的数据集混合，未来应开发基于梯度级别的修正方法来处理多任务后训练中的梯度不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中通信受限的问题，需要在减少通信开销的同时维持智能体间的有效协调。

Method: 采用去中心化actor-critic学习框架，每个智能体在与其邻居交换信息前执行多次局部策略和价值函数更新，其中价值函数由多层神经网络近似。

Result: 在马尔可夫采样下建立了有限时间收敛分析，达到ε-精确驻点的样本复杂度为O(ε⁻³)，通信复杂度为O(ε⁻¹τ⁻¹)，其中τ为局部训练步数。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的局部训练策略显著降低了通信负担，同时保持了网络协调，为通信受限的多智能体强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

Motivation: 传统基于扩散的GNN模拟被动热扩散，存在过平滑问题，限制了捕获全局图信息的能力。受宇宙热寂启发，认识到在没有外部输入的情况下，节点表示会收敛到相同的特征向量。

Conclusion: ADGNN能有效捕获全局图信息并保持节点独特性，证明了主动扩散方法的有效性。

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器遗忘方法作为单目标优化问题面临三个主要挑战：过度遗忘风险、缺乏细粒度控制以及缺乏全面评估权衡的指标。需要解决遗忘效果与模型保真度之间的关键权衡问题。

Method: 将机器遗忘重新定义为多目标优化问题，提出CUP算法，采用独特的梯度枢轴机制，通过单一直观的超参数'遗忘强度'来精确控制帕累托前沿上的权衡选择。

Result: 实验结果表明，CUP能够生成更优的帕累托最优解集，在各种视觉任务中持续优于现有方法，使用超体积指标验证了其生成解集的质量和多样性优势。

Conclusion: CUP方法通过多目标优化框架有效解决了机器遗忘中的权衡问题，提供了可控的遗忘过程，为机器遗忘研究提供了新的方向和评估标准。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts

brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

Motivation: 在高风险决策中需要可解释的强化学习策略，但优化MDP中的决策树策略仍然具有挑战性。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，SPOT实现了显著加速，可扩展到状态数更多的更大MDP，生成的决策树策略既紧凑又可解释。

Conclusion: 该方法同时实现了可解释性和可扩展性，比现有方法快一个数量级地提供高质量策略。

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

Motivation: 深度强化学习虽然性能卓越但缺乏可解释性，限制了对其策略行为的信任。现有的SILVER框架仅限于低维、二元动作领域，需要扩展到更复杂的环境。

Method: 首先从图像观察中提取紧凑特征表示，进行SHAP特征归因，然后使用RL引导标记生成行为一致的边界数据集，最后训练决策树和回归函数等替代模型来解释RL策略的决策结构。

Result: 在两个Atari环境中使用三种深度RL算法进行评估，并通过人类主体研究评估了可解释策略的清晰度和可信度。结果显示该方法在保持竞争性任务性能的同时，显著提高了透明度和人类对智能体行为的理解。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过将SILVER转变为可扩展且具有行为感知的框架，推进了可解释强化学习在高维多动作设置中的发展。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

Conclusion: GraMixC作为一种即插即用模块，通过有效利用多分辨率配置信息，显著提升了各种下游任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on

TL;DR: 提出CAB框架，通过注意力桥接实现跨架构蒸馏，将Transformer教师模型的知识高效迁移到状态空间模型学生模型中


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型虽然比Transformer更高效，但训练成本高且生态系统不成熟，且与Transformer的结构异质性使得知识蒸馏困难

Method: 使用轻量级注意力桥接实现token级监督，结合灵活的层间对齐策略来适应师生模型间的架构差异

Result: 在视觉和语言领域的广泛实验表明，该方法在有限训练数据下持续提升状态空间模型性能，优于标准和跨架构蒸馏方法

Conclusion: 基于注意力的知识可以有效迁移到循环模型中，有助于快速利用Transformer专业知识构建更强的SSM社区

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

*Sehyun Park,Jongjin Lee,Yunseop Shin,Ilsang Ohn,Yongdai Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出高斯蒸馏方法，通过深度隐因子模型将教师集成压缩为学生分布而非学生集成，解决了知识蒸馏中不确定性保持的难题，在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度集成虽然能提供最先进的不确定性量化，但其计算和内存需求限制了在实际应用中的部署。现有知识蒸馏技术在压缩集成时难以保持不确定性，因为减小DNN尺寸通常会导致方差减少。

Method: 提出高斯蒸馏方法，使用深度隐因子模型（DLF）将教师集成建模为随机过程的实现，通过期望最大化算法稳定估计DLF模型的均值和协方差函数，实现从教师集成到学生分布的压缩。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，高斯蒸馏方法优于现有基线方法。同时证明该方法在语言模型微调和分布偏移问题上也表现良好。

Conclusion: 高斯蒸馏通过将教师集成压缩为学生分布而非学生集成，有效解决了知识蒸馏中不确定性保持的问题，为实际应用中的模型压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出QiMeng-SALV方法，通过利用功能正确的输出信号的代码片段来优化Verilog代码生成的强化学习训练，实现了从模块级到信号级的细粒度优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在Verilog代码生成方面展现出潜力，但缺乏有意义的功能奖励阻碍了基于强化学习的偏好优化，难以生成功能正确的Verilog代码。

Method: 通过验证生成模块中信号的功能正确性，使用抽象语法树识别信号感知代码片段，引入信号感知DPO在正确的信号级代码段上进行优化，避免错误信号的干扰。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM基准测试中达到最先进性能，7B参数模型匹配DeepSeek v3 671B模型的性能，显著优于在同一数据集上训练的开源模型CodeV。

Conclusion: QiMeng-SALV标志着Verilog代码生成从传统模块级优化向细粒度信号级优化的范式转变，解决了功能奖励不足的问题。

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

*Mingyu Jo,Jaesik Yoon,Justin Deschenaux,Caglar Gulcehre,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜变量路径保留分布信息，解决了离散扩散模型采样时信息坍塌的问题，显著提升了非自回归文本生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在并行解码时存在采样墙问题：一旦进行类别采样，丰富的分布信息就会坍缩为one-hot向量，无法在步骤间传播，导致后续步骤信息受限。

Method: 引入Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜变量路径保留分布信息，结合自条件训练策略，构建Loopholing离散扩散模型(LDDMs)。

Result: 生成困惑度比先前基线降低高达61%，缩小甚至超越与自回归模型的差距，生成更连贯的文本；在推理任务中提升Countdown和Game of 24等算术基准性能。

Conclusion: Loopholing机制缓解了空闲步骤和振荡问题，为高质量非自回归文本生成提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Motivation: 传统物种监测方法覆盖范围有限且不完整，需要更准确和可扩展的物种分布模型来支持生物多样性保护工作。

Method: 使用深度学习和数据填补技术，结合数据平衡和特征选择，开发多模态集成模型整合土地覆盖、NDVI等环境变量。

Result: 数据平衡使青蛙计数任务的MAE从189降至29；多模态模型在栖息地分类中达到84.9%准确率和0.90 AUC；特征选择确定了关键环境因素。

Conclusion: 多模态学习和数据预处理技术（如平衡和填补）能够显著提高生态预测模型的准确性，特别是在数据稀疏或不完整的情况下，为更精确和可扩展的生物多样性监测做出贡献。

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在关键决策中需要高度可靠的预测，校准性能往往被忽视但至关重要，特别是在临床预测等应用中。

Method: 使用学习到的输入样本表示进行聚类，在每个聚类上训练校准函数集成，并引入独特的匹配度量来优化模型选择。

Result: 将各种方法的校准分数从82.28%提升到100%，在保持区分度的同时显著改善校准性能。

Conclusion: 该通用方案适应任何底层表示、聚类、校准方法和度量，提供了灵活性并在常用校准方法中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

Motivation: 解决长上下文推理场景中传统模型I/O和计算开销过大的问题，通过混合注意力架构来优化推理成本。

Method: 采用线性注意力和softmax注意力的混合架构，通过系统探索不同注意力机制的比例找到最优结构，并利用自研的高性能FP8算子库linghe提升训练效率。

Result: 相比32B参数密集模型，推理成本降低到1/10；相比原始Ring系列，成本降低超过50%；训练效率提升50%；在多个复杂推理基准测试中保持SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Ring-linear模型系列通过混合注意力架构和优化技术，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了推理和训练成本，为长上下文推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 时间序列基础模型虽然预测准确，但预测形式（点预测、分位数预测、参数预测或轨迹集成）限制了其实际应用价值。许多操作任务需要轨迹集成来保持时间依赖性，但三分之二的模型只产生点或参数预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型主要关注预测准确性，但忽略了预测形式对实际应用价值的影响。许多操作任务需要轨迹集成来保持时间依赖性，而现有模型大多无法提供这种形式的预测。

Method: 调查了近期的时间序列基础模型，分析不同预测类型之间的转换可能性。证明边际分布无法确定路径依赖事件概率，并建立了六种基本预测任务与最小充分预测类型的映射关系。

Result: 发现三分之二的时间序列基础模型只产生点或参数预测，而许多操作任务需要轨迹集成。轨迹集成可以简化为更简单的形式，但反向转换需要额外假设。

Conclusion: 预测类型而不仅仅是准确性决定了实际效用。需要开发能够产生轨迹集成预测的模型，并为不同任务提供任务对齐的评估框架。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分支定界法求解混合整数线性规划时，变量选择启发式策略对性能影响很大。现有研究尝试用强化学习学习最优分支策略，但缺乏原则性的MDP公式。

Method: 提出了BBMDP，一个用于分支定界变量选择的标准MDP公式，可以应用广泛的强化学习算法来学习最优分支启发式策略。

Result: 计算实验验证了模型的有效性，提出的分支代理在四个标准MILP基准测试中超越了现有最先进的RL代理。

Conclusion: BBMDP提供了一个原则性的MDP框架，能够有效学习分支定界中的最优变量选择策略，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

Conclusion: Scalable LinUCB算法通过低秩近似显著提升了线性上下文bandit的可扩展性，适用于大规模推荐系统应用。

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

Conclusion: 该框架在严重环境干扰下表现出鲁棒性，适用于网络物理系统中的安全和智能导航。

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多系统会随时间老化或退化，但传感器数据中可能没有直接的'年龄'信息。需要从现有数据中发现能代表系统年龄的代理特征。

Method: 使用精心定义的语法生成候选公式，通过优化公式的单调性（基于Spearman秩相关系数）来评估和选择最佳代理特征。

Result: 在人工生成数据集和两个真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法能将单调性较低的单传感器组合成高单调性的潜在特征。在InfraWatch结构健康监测项目中，两个单传感器特征（Spearman ρ=0.13和0.09）组合后达到ρ=0.95。

Conclusion: 该方法能够发现可解释的公式作为系统'年龄'的有效代理，即使单个传感器的单调性很低。

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

TL;DR: ADAligner是一个动态、质量感知的图-文本对齐框架，能够根据监督质量在表达性多对多和保守一对一目标之间动态调整，解决了现有方法在处理真实世界图中多对多关系和噪声监督时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP风格图-文本对齐器面临两个关键限制：假设节点和文本之间存在严格的一对一对应关系，忽略了真实世界图中固有的多对多关系；依赖无法适应不同数据质量的静态对齐目标，在噪声监督下变得脆弱。

Method: ADAligner实时估计批次级别的对齐可靠性，并相应调整优化策略。当监督干净时促进软性、子图级别的多对多对齐，而在噪声下通过动态过滤低置信度对来强调可靠的一对一对齐。

Result: 在九个不同的TAG数据集上的综合实验表明，ADAligner在零样本/少样本节点分类、链接预测和跨模态检索任务上始终优于先前的图-文本对齐器。在噪声监督下保持强鲁棒性，相比多模态基线加速预训练约2到3倍。

Conclusion: ADAligner为真实世界网络环境中的图-文本表示学习建立了一个可扩展且可靠的基础，通过动态质量感知机制解决了图-文本对齐中的核心困境。

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

*Songqi Zhou,Zeyuan Liu,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairNet是一个动态实例级公平性校正框架，通过偏置检测器和条件低秩适配（LoRA）实现选择性公平校正，同时保持无偏实例的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法往往牺牲模型性能，依赖静态校正策略，难以处理数据稀疏性（特别是少数群体），且对敏感属性的利用不够优化。

Method: 整合偏置检测器与条件LoRA，仅对检测为有偏的实例激活公平校正机制；提出新的对比损失函数，减少不同敏感群体间的类内表示差异；灵活处理完整、部分或缺失的敏感属性标签。

Result: 理论分析表明，在偏置检测器TPR/FPR适中的情况下，FairNet能提升最差群体性能而不降低整体性能，甚至可能带来轻微性能提升；在多种视觉和语言基准测试中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: FairNet提供了一个动态、实例级的公平性校正解决方案，能有效处理数据稀疏问题，并在保持整体性能的同时提升少数群体表现。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CPSVD方法，通过智能分割参数矩阵，保留高分解误差的列，仅对低分解误差列应用SVD，并自适应分配非均匀压缩率，显著提升LLM压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD方法将整个参数矩阵统一处理，忽略了不同部分SVD近似误差的显著差异，导致压缩效果不佳。

Method: CPSVD方法识别并直接保留高分解误差的矩阵列，仅对低分解误差列应用SVD，精确确定两种策略的最佳平衡点，并自适应分配非均匀压缩率。

Result: 大量实验表明CPSVD在零样本任务上持续优于最先进的SVD压缩方法，实现更低的困惑度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: CPSVD通过智能矩阵分割和自适应压缩率分配，有效解决了传统SVD压缩的局限性，显著提升了LLM压缩性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

Motivation: 学习推断条件后验模型是鲁棒元学习的关键步骤，需要解决多任务少样本学习中的功能模糊性和不确定性。

Method: 使用任务特定dropout建模条件后验分布，采用低秩伯努利专家元模型从少量观察上下文中映射dropout率，通过基于整个任务数据的新颖先验优化条件dropout后验。

Result: 在1D随机回归、图像修复和分类等少样本学习任务中，NVDPs相比其他元学习方法表现出优异性能。

Conclusion: NVDPs能够稳健地近似任务特定dropout率，有效处理广泛的功能模糊性和不确定性，实现快速重新配置共享神经网络以适应新任务。

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应秩分配(ARA)方法，用于解决大语言模型SVD压缩中的秩分配问题，通过专用掩码设计和额外损失函数实现全局最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法存在局限性：启发式算法搜索空间受限，基于掩码的训练难以有效捕捉奇异值谱与可训练参数的关系，且忽略了增益函数在压缩比为1时的非光滑特性，导致训练陷入局部最优。

Method: ARA方法包含：(1)专用掩码设计，实现保留秩与可训练参数之间的高效映射和更新；(2)额外损失函数，引导参数选择朝向全局最优解。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B模型上，80%压缩比下，WikiText2困惑度从8.38降至6.42，零样本任务平均准确率相比均匀压缩提升9.72个百分点。

Conclusion: ARA方法在SVD基LLM压缩中实现了最先进的秩分配性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

Motivation: 随着AI系统接近危险能力水平，传统的不可能安全案例已不足够，需要替代方法来确保安全。思维链监控可能同时支持控制和可信度的安全案例。

Method: 提出两部分安全案例：1）建立模型在没有思维链时缺乏危险能力；2）确保思维链启用的危险能力可被思维链监控检测。系统分析监控性威胁（神经语和编码推理），评估保持思维链忠实性的技术，探索从不可监控思维链中提取可监控思维链的可能性。

Conclusion: 思维链监控为构建AI安全案例提供了有前景的路径，但需要解决监控性威胁和确保思维链忠实性等关键技术挑战。

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

Motivation: 解决物理信息神经网络中存在的频谱偏差问题，即神经网络倾向于先学习低频特征，难以准确逼近高频PDE。

Method: 使用随机傅里叶特征增强隐空间，创建两阶段训练：在特征空间中估计基函数，然后确定增强基函数的系数回归问题。对于线性模型，该问题是凸的。

Result: 通过经典基准问题的广泛数值评估，证明了该方法在性能上优于最先进算法，并展示了在整个频域上的改进逼近能力。

Conclusion: IFeF-PINN通过傅里叶特征增强和迭代训练，有效克服了频谱偏差，能够准确逼近高频PDE，在数值实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

Conclusion: INPO框架通过减缓发散速度和增强模型效用稳健性，有效解决了图遗忘过程中的效用退化问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

Motivation: 现有遗忘方法使用梯度上升降低目标响应的概率，但会导致概率质量重新分布到高似然区域（语义相关的重述），形成"挤压效应"，造成虚假遗忘。

Method: 提出引导框架(BS)，将挤压效应与模型自身高置信度生成（模型信念）联系起来。通过同时抑制目标响应和模型信念，BS-T衰减高概率令牌，BS-S移除整个高置信度生成，实现更彻底的遗忘。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和多种模型家族上的广泛实验证实了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过直接对抗挤压效应，提出的引导框架实现了更彻底的语言模型遗忘，同时保持了模型效用。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

Conclusion: REBMBO通过自适应多步前瞻策略有效克服了传统贝叶斯优化的局限性，在复杂优化任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Method: 在不同数据集上测试对抗鲁棒模型的表示相似性和预测行为，分析分类层对预测差异的影响，并通过重新训练分类器来改善预测普适性。

Result: 在特定设置下验证了高表示相似性，但结果在不同数据集间不一致；预测行为不会随鲁棒性增加而收敛；分类层是预测差异的主要来源；通过重新训练分类器可以实现更普适的预测行为。

Conclusion: 神经网络在特定设置下表现出部分普适性，但不存在严格的普适性概念；预测行为可以通过简单的分类器重新训练来改善普适性。

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

Conclusion: 联邦聚类方法能够有效处理分布式分子数据，但需要结合领域知识和专门的化学评估指标来获得有意义的结果。

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

Conclusion: g-DPO在保持DPO性能的同时显著提高了训练效率，特别适用于大规模数据集

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

Method: 提出分层线性量化(HLQ)格式，能更好地捕捉权重统计特征而不增加基于位串查找表的GEMM操作计算成本，可无缝集成到各种量化流程中，并提供优化的CPU内核进行端到端推理。

Result: 对于LLaMA3-8B，HLQ在3位精度下降低困惑度约8%，在2位精度下降低85%；在Apple M2芯片上，2位LLaMA2-7B实现超过25 tokens/s的推理速度。

Conclusion: ELUTQ框架通过HLQ量化格式有效解决了边缘设备上LLM部署的内存和延迟瓶颈，在保持高效推理的同时显著提升了低比特量化的性能。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

TL;DR: SpikeQuant是一种结合脉冲神经网络和混合精度量化的方法，通过将激活值重新编码为二进制脉冲计数，在W4A4量化下实现接近FP16的精度，同时将能耗降低4.6倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在边缘设备部署时的三个关键挑战：MAC操作能耗高、反量化引入额外开销、均匀位宽量化会裁剪重要值。

Method: 选择性对重要激活值应用混合精度量化，将其重新编码为二进制脉冲计数，并通过将量化尺度嵌入IF机制的阈值来避免显式反量化。

Result: 在W4A4量化下保持接近FP16的困惑度，同时能耗比现有方法降低4.6倍。

Conclusion: SpikeQuant通过脉冲神经网络和混合量化策略，为大语言模型提供了准确且高能效的部署方案。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

Conclusion: TraDy在保持严格内存约束的同时，通过动态随机通道选择实现了高效的深度学习训练。

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly
important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict
resource constraints. We propose TraDy, a novel transfer learning scheme
leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is
architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic
channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static
approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that
stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict
memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight
derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative
computation.

Motivation: 现有的单模型一致性方法虽然有效，但仍有局限性。通过结合多个不同LLM的响应，可以进一步改进幻觉检测和缓解能力，并克服单模型方法的推理成本问题。

Method: 将单模型一致性方法扩展到多个LLM，整合来自不同训练数据、训练方案和模型架构的多个LLM的响应，形成多模型一致性方法。

Conclusion: 多模型一致性方法通过整合多个不同LLM的响应，在幻觉检测和缓解方面优于单模型方法，且具有成本效益，为LLM可靠性提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在重症监护中隐私保护下的模型评估问题，需要一种能够在不暴露敏感电子健康记录数据的情况下，进行可信、细粒度模型评估的方法。

Method: 在现有扩散和VAE生成器基础上，引入Enhanced TimeAutoDiff，通过添加分布对齐惩罚来增强潜在扩散目标，并在MIMIC-III和eICU数据集上对24小时死亡率和住院时间任务进行广泛基准测试。

Result: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff将真实-合成数据评估差距减少了70%以上，达到ΔTRTS ≤ 0.014 AUROC，同时保持训练效用。在32个交叉亚组中，大型合成队列将亚组级AUROC估计误差减少了50%，并在72-84%的亚组中优于小型真实测试集。

Conclusion: 这项工作为重症监护中可信、细粒度的模型评估提供了实用的隐私保护路线图，能够在不同患者群体中进行稳健可靠的性能分析，有助于提升医疗AI的整体可信度。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

Method: 开发了基于实验数据的无偏OR决策质量估计器，通过代理损失函数连接离散优化梯度；建立双层优化框架联合利用观察和实验数据，通过隐式微分求解。

Result: 在公共基准测试、工业营销数据集和大规模在线A/B测试中验证了Bi-DFCL的有效性，相比现有最优方法取得了统计显著的改进，已在美团平台部署。

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL通过系统性地解决预测-决策不对齐和偏差-方差困境，实现了最优的偏差-方差权衡，在真实工业场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

Result: 该方法在开放式机器人任务上实现了策略改进，相比基于重建的世界建模方法有显著的泛化能力提升。

Conclusion: 语义世界模型继承了预训练视觉语言模型的泛化和鲁棒性，能够更有效地支持机器人决策规划。

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

Conclusion: MED-LQ展示了在大型MDP中更广泛应用潜力，成功将CI和MED原则扩展到小规模设置之外

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

Conclusion: ForecastNet-XCL的效率、性能和不确定性感知设计使其成为可部署的早期预警工具，特别适用于气候压力加剧和监测资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疏散模拟依赖精细化建模和大量参数，难以在早期设计阶段快速迭代过程中采用，需要更高效的模拟方法。

Method: 建立包含399种功能布局和对应疏散热力图的数据集，提出解耦特征表示方法嵌入物理特征，基于图像提示的扩散模型学习疏散模式。

Result: 相比使用条件GAN和RGB表示的方法，DiffEvac在SSIM上提升37.6%，PSNR提升142%，速度快16倍，模拟时间缩短至2分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了快速设计迭代效率，为智能建筑设计中的安全优化提供了新思路，降低了建模负担，支持大规模假设探索。

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a

demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

Motivation: 现有的LoRA变体缺乏明确区分任务相关信息与残差信息的机制，这限制了在下游任务中的性能表现。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习两个不同的潜在空间，通过新的证据下界公式化促进潜在空间的因子分解，一个空间专门用于任务显著特征，另一个用于残差信息。

Result: 在文本、音频和图像任务上的广泛实验表明，FVAE-LoRA始终优于标准LoRA。虚假相关性评估证实该方法能更好地隔离任务相关信号，在分布偏移下具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA通过因子分解的潜在空间设计，有效提升了LoRA在下游任务中的性能，并增强了模型对分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly

Motivation: 在时间变化设置中估计异质处理效应面临严重的数据重叠问题，因为观察某些治疗序列的概率随预测时间延长而指数下降，现有方法在低重叠情况下估计方差会爆炸性增长。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的Neyman正交总体风险函数，最小化重叠加权的oracle风险，创建了重叠加权正交元学习器，该方法是完全模型无关的。

Conclusion: 提出的WO学习器具有Neyman正交性的有利特性，对干扰函数中的错误设定具有鲁棒性，能够有效解决时间变化设置中的异质处理效应估计问题。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

*Ayush Sawarni,Jikai Jin,Justin Whitehouse,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究策略学习中的弃权机制，允许策略在不确定时选择默认选项，并提出两阶段学习器实现快速后悔保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统策略学习算法在预测不确定时仍强制决策，这在高风险场景中很危险。需要允许策略在不确定时弃权，选择安全默认选项。

Method: 提出两阶段学习器：首先识别一组近似最优策略，然后基于这些策略的分歧构建弃权规则。使用双重稳健目标处理未知倾向得分情况。

Result: 在已知倾向得分时获得O(1/n)型快速后悔保证，并扩展到未知倾向得分情况。弃权机制还能改善边际条件下的性能保证，连接分布鲁棒策略学习，支持安全策略改进。

Conclusion: 弃权是策略学习中的多功能工具，能在不确定时提供安全机制，改善性能保证，并支持鲁棒性和安全性要求。

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

*Amir Globerson,Haim Kaplan,Yishay Mansour,Clara Mohri,Tal Schuster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了分层推测解码（HSD）算法，通过将多个草稿模型堆叠成层次结构来减少Transformer语言模型的推理延迟，相比最佳单草稿基线可获得最高1.2倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法通常只使用单个草稿模型，但实际上存在多个潜在草稿模型，它们在速度和准确性之间存在权衡。为了充分利用这些模型的优势，需要一种更高效的层次化验证方法。

Method: HSD算法将多个草稿模型堆叠成层次结构，每个模型提出token，下一个更大的模型在单次前向传播中验证这些token，最终由目标模型进行最终验证。

Result: 推导出了任意层次结构的期望延迟表达式，并证明可以在多项式时间内选择延迟最优的层次结构。实证结果显示，HSD相比最佳单草稿基线可获得最高1.2倍的加速。

Conclusion: HSD算法通过层次化利用多个草稿模型，有效减少了生成延迟，超越了以往的技术，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEMPO是一个轻量级时间序列基础模型，通过能量感知谱分解和混合提示Transformer，在减少预训练数据规模和模型大小的同时，实现了强大的零样本和少样本预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型需要大规模预训练数据和庞大网络架构，难以在资源受限环境中部署。为解决通用性与成本效益之间的矛盾，需要开发轻量级但性能强大的模型。

Method: 1) 能量感知谱分解模块：同时建模高能量和低能量频率信号，提高预训练数据利用率；2) 混合提示Transformer：通过数据集特定提示学习异构时序模式，自适应地将时间序列token路由到基于提示的专家进行参数高效适配。

Result: 在两个大规模基准测试的16个数据集上，SEMPO在零样本和少样本预测场景中均优于现有最先进方法，显著减少了预训练数据规模和模型大小。

Conclusion: SEMPO成功解决了时间序列基础模型在资源受限环境中的部署问题，在保持强大泛化能力的同时显著降低了计算和存储需求。

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available
at https://github.com/mala-lab/SEMPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文为在线最小二乘SGD的线性泛函建立了非渐近Berry-Esseen界，在增长维度机制下提供了高斯中心极限定理，显著扩展了先前工作的维度范围并提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中部署SGD需要严格量化其固有不确定性，现有方法计算成本高且维度扩展受限。

Method: 使用在线SGD程序，开发在线方差估计器，并建立该估计器的高概率偏差界。

Result: SGD迭代在迭代次数增长为t ≳ d^(1+δ)时满足CLT，计算复杂度为O(td)，内存需求为O(d)，优于协方差逆方法的O(td² + d³)。

Conclusion: 提出了第一个完全在线和数据驱动的框架，在接近最优的缩放机制t ≳ d^(1+δ)下为SGD迭代构建置信区间。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习物种分布模型受限于数据的空间偏差，在数据稀缺地区效果不佳，需要更好处理不确定性的方法来结合局部观测与生态模式。

Method: 引入BATIS框架，采用贝叶斯深度学习，迭代更新先验预测，综合处理偶然性和认知不确定性，在eBird公民科学数据集上测试多种不确定性量化方法。

Result: 贝叶斯深度学习方法能显著提高物种分布模型在数据稀缺位置的可靠性，有效结合细粒度局部洞察与广泛生态模式。

Conclusion: BATIS框架通过贝叶斯方法改进物种分布模型，为生态理解和保护工作提供更可靠的预测工具，特别是在数据稀缺地区。

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文解释了Transformer在算法学习中的局限性，通过图连通性问题展示了模型倾向于学习简单启发式而非通用算法。理论证明L层Transformer只能解决直径不超过3^L的图，训练数据是否在模型容量内决定了学习结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型经常学习脆弱的启发式方法而非通用算法，本文旨在从理论和实验上解释这一现象，特别以图连通性问题作为测试平台。

Method: 使用简化的解耦Transformer架构，理论证明L层模型只能解决直径不超过3^L的图，相当于计算邻接矩阵的幂。分析训练动态，比较在模型容量内和超出容量的训练数据对学习策略的影响。

Result: 理论证明L层Transformer最多能处理直径3^L的图。实验表明：当训练数据在模型容量内时，模型学习正确的算法；超出容量时，模型学习基于节点度的简单启发式方法。限制训练数据在容量内可使标准和解耦Transformer都学习精确算法。

Conclusion: Transformer学习算法还是启发式取决于训练数据是否在模型容量内。在容量内学习通用算法，超出容量则学习简单启发式。通过控制训练数据范围可以引导模型学习期望的算法。

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

TL;DR: CONFEX是一种基于共形预测和混合整数线性规划的不确定性感知反事实解释方法，提供局部覆盖保证，确保反事实解释避开高预测不确定性区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法往往忽视预测不确定性，缺乏将不确定性纳入解释的机制和形式化保证，可能导致解释在不确定性高的区域不可靠或误导。

Method: 提出CONFEX方法，结合共形预测和混合整数线性规划，通过离线树基输入空间划分开发局部化CP过程，实现高效MILP编码。

Result: 在多个基准测试和指标上评估CONFEX，证明该方法能产生鲁棒且合理的解释，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CONFEX能够生成具有严格预测不确定性和最优性保证的反事实解释，解决了CFX生成违反可交换性的问题。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的成员推理攻击需要训练大量计算昂贵的参考模型，限制了实用性。本文旨在开发一种无需参考模型的模型级脆弱性评估方法。

Method: 利用训练和测试分布分析损失分布的不对称性和重尾特性，发现高风险点从分布尾部（高损失区域）转移到头部（低损失区域），通过高损失区域异常值的缺失来预测模型脆弱性。

Result: 该方法在多种架构和数据集上准确估计了模型对最先进MIA攻击（LiRA）的脆弱性，优于低成本攻击（如RMIA）和其他分布差异度量方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估模型隐私风险提供了一种高效实用的替代方案，在大型语言模型风险评估方面也显示出潜力。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏微调技术的有效性取决于最优选择要微调的模型参数，现有方法在参数选择上仍有改进空间。

Method: 基于梯度幅度和预训练参数幅度的双重标准选择要微调的稀疏参数子集，优先选择高任务相关性和低预训练知识破坏的参数。

Result: 在LLaMA3 8B和Gemma 2B上的实验表明，GaLLoP在分布内和分布外性能上一致优于或匹配其他参数高效微调技术，并能缓解灾难性遗忘和任务数据记忆问题。

Conclusion: GaLLoP通过智能参数选择实现了稳定且泛化性强的稀疏微调，在保持性能的同时减少了对预训练知识的破坏。

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法依赖I.I.D.数据假设，环境泛化技术需要环境标签，但这些标签在训练时往往因数据采集挑战、隐私问题和环境变异性而不可得。

Method: 通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来推断环境规范，实现直接从数据中进行环境分配。

Conclusion: DynaInfer有效解决了无标签场景下的交替优化问题，为处理环境差异提供了一种无需环境标签的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

Motivation: 研究Transformer是否能在无需额外训练的情况下，仅通过少量上下文示例作为元学习器适应新任务，填补现有理论分析在正式元学习设置中的空白。

Method: 采用简化Transformer架构，在线性分类设置中训练，考虑任务家族为类条件高斯混合模型，均值向量位于共享k维子空间。

Result: 训练足够多任务后，Transformer仅需O(k/R^4)个上下文示例就能泛化到新任务，性能接近知道共享子空间的最优学习器，显著优于仅使用上下文数据的方法（需Ω(d/R^4)示例）。

Conclusion: Transformer确实能作为有效的元学习器，训练任务和示例数量与环境维度d无关，证明了其强大的上下文学习能力。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练的计算需求加剧了全球南北之间的结构性不对称，研究旨在探索中等收入国家在硬件受限条件下建立主权AI能力的可行性。

Method: 采用双轴设计，比较不同加速器（NVIDIA H100 vs A100）和训练时长（90天 vs 150天），估算计算需求、能耗、资本支出和监管兼容性。

Result: 所有配置均低于出口管制和电力基础设施阈值，H100方案在800-1400万美元成本下可行，A100方案因能耗和硬件需求更高需1900-3200万美元。

Conclusion: 延长训练时间应作为缓解硬件约束的政策工具，使中等收入国家能够建立可持续且战略充足的AI能力，生产可用、可审计和本地对齐的模型。

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

Abstract: Graph vertex ordering is widely employed in spatial data analysis, especially
in urban analytics, where street graphs serve as spatial discretization for
modeling and simulation. It is also crucial for visualization, as many methods
require vertices to be arranged in a well-defined order to reveal non-trivial
patterns. The goal of vertex ordering methods is to preserve neighborhood
relations, but the structural complexity of real-world graphs often introduces
distortions. Comparing different ordering methods is therefore essential to
identify the most suitable one for each application. Existing metrics for
assessing spatial vertex ordering typically focus on global quality, which
hinders the identification of localized distortions. Visual evaluation is
particularly valuable, as it allows analysts to compare methods within a single
visualization, assess distortions, identify anomalous regions, and, in urban
contexts, explain spatial inconsistencies. This work presents a
visualization-assisted tool for assessing vertex ordering techniques, with a
focus on urban analytics. We evaluate geometric and topological ordering
approaches using urban street graphs. The visual tool integrates existing and
newly proposed metrics, validated through experiments on data from multiple
cities. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively supports
users in selecting suitable vertex ordering techniques, tuning hyperparameters,
and identifying regions with high ordering distortions.
