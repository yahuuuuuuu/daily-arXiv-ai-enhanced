### [1] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习模型中对水下目标检测的有效性，比较了标准YOLOv5、时间增强的T-YOLOv5以及加入CBAM模块的T-YOLOv5的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在提高水下目标检测在动态海洋环境中的准确性，特别是在处理突然运动、部分遮挡和渐变运动等挑战性场景时。

Method: 第一阶段评估时间增强的T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能；第二阶段开发了加入卷积块注意力模块(CBAM)的T-YOLOv5增强版本。

Result: YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，而T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5+CBAM分别达到0.813和0.811，在复杂目标检测中表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T-YOLOv5相比标准模型显著提高了检测可靠性，T-YOLOv5+CBAM在挑战性场景中性能更优，但在简单场景下存在精度损失。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [2] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练期间直接让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，而不是事后选择生成的图像，从而提高了图像生成的质量和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在大规模未筛选数据集上训练，虽然能够实现多样化的生成能力，但与用户偏好不一致。现有的奖励模型通过事后选择生成的图像来对齐奖励，但这种方法会损害多样性、语义保真度和效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练期间让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，直接学习用户偏好，而不是进行事后处理。

Result: MIRO方法显著提高了生成图像的视觉质量，并显著加快了训练速度。在GenEval组合基准和用户偏好评分（PickAScore、ImageReward、HPSv2）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过在训练期间直接学习多个奖励模型的条件，MIRO方法能够更好地对齐用户偏好，同时保持多样性和语义保真度，提高了图像生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

Conclusion: 领域特定训练对于自行车感知系统至关重要，BikeScenes数据集将推动以骑行者为中心的LiDAR分割研究发展。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [4] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于机器学习的STM图像修复和超分辨率方法，通过物理信息合成数据训练模型，有效恢复图像质量并减少2-4倍图像采集时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决STM技术中针尖退化和缓慢串行数据采集的限制问题，减少针尖调节频率并提高实验吞吐量。

Method: 使用仅36张原始实验图像，通过物理信息合成数据生成管道训练最先进的流匹配和扩散模型。

Result: 模型能有效修复图像，通过稀疏采样数据准确重建图像，实现2-4倍的图像采集时间减少。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力显著提高STM实验吞吐量，减少针尖调节频率并增强现有高速STM系统的帧率。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [5] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流分解与聚合的无反演图像编辑框架，通过语义分解目标提示词、独立计算子流并自适应聚合来解决传统流模型在图像编辑中的反转不准确和梯度纠缠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的整流流模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但在图像编辑任务中存在关键限制：将真实图像映射回潜在空间的反转过程不准确，编辑过程中的梯度纠缠问题导致输出无法忠实反映目标提示词。

Method: 采用流分解与聚合框架：语义分解目标提示词为多个子提示词，为每个子提示词计算独立流，然后通过投影和软聚合机制自适应加权子目标速度场，抑制语义冗余并强调不同方向。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在语义保真度和属性解缠方面优于现有的零样本编辑方法。

Conclusion: 提出的流分解与聚合框架有效解决了流模型在图像编辑中的反转不准确和梯度纠缠问题，能够生成既多样化又语义一致的编辑输出。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at

Abstract: Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly transformed
the landscape of 3D scene representations, inspiring an extensive body of
associated research. Follow-up work includes analyses and contributions that
enhance the efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability of 3DGS. In
this summary, we present an overview of several key directions that have
emerged in the wake of 3DGS. We highlight advances enabling resource-efficient
training and rendering, the evolution toward dynamic (or four-dimensional,
4DGS) representations, and deeper exploration of the mathematical foundations
underlying its appearance modeling and rendering process. Furthermore, we
examine efforts to bring 3DGS to mobile and virtual reality platforms, its
extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward
near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed
computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved
from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for
3D vision and graphics.

### [7] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Brain-IT方法，通过大脑交互Transformer从fMRI脑记录重建视觉图像，在有限数据下实现高保真重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的方法在从fMRI重建图像时缺乏对实际所见图像的真实还原

Method: 使用Brain Interaction Transformer(BIT)实现功能相似脑体素簇之间的有效交互，预测高层语义和低层结构特征来引导扩散模型

Result: 在视觉和客观指标上超越现有方法，仅用1小时fMRI数据即可达到与40小时数据训练方法相当的结果

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过大脑启发的功能簇交互机制，实现了从fMRI脑记录的高保真图像重建

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

### [8] [HEIR: Learning Graph-Based Motion Hierarchies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26786)
*Cheng Zheng,William Koch,Baiang Li,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的分层运动建模方法，通过图学习直接从数据中学习结构化和可解释的运动关系，将全局绝对运动分解为父级继承模式和局部运动残差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动定义或启发式的固定运动基元层次结构，限制了在不同任务间的泛化能力。需要一种能够直接从数据中学习运动层次结构的通用方法。

Method: 将层次推断构建为可微分的图学习问题，使用顶点表示基本运动，通过图神经网络捕获学习到的父子依赖关系。

Result: 在1D平移运动、2D旋转运动和3D高斯溅射场景变形三个示例上验证，能够重建内在运动层次结构，在动态3D高斯溅射场景中相比基线产生更真实和可解释的变形。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个适用于广泛运动中心任务的适应性、数据驱动的分层建模范式。

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对TrackRAD2025挑战，在数据稀缺条件下开发了基于SAM 2.1基础模型的实时肿瘤跟踪方法，在隐藏测试集上获得0.8794的Dice分数，排名第6。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在胸腔和腹部区域cine-MRI序列中实时肿瘤跟踪的挑战，特别是在强数据稀缺约束下。

Method: 采用SAM 2.1基础模型进行分割，使用第一标注切片的掩码提示，在TrackRAD2025的小标注子集上进行微调，采用低学习率(0.0001)和平衡的Dice+IoU损失函数。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上获得0.8794的Dice相似系数，在TrackRAD2025挑战中排名第6。

Conclusion: 基础模型在MRI引导放射治疗中具有准确和实时肿瘤跟踪的强大潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

TL;DR: SEE4D是一个无需姿态标注的视频到4D内容生成框架，通过虚拟相机渲染和条件视频修复技术，从随意拍摄的视频中合成时空4D内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到4D方法依赖手动标注的相机姿态，这在实际应用中成本高且脆弱。需要开发无需姿态监督的方法来处理真实世界视频。

Method: 采用轨迹到相机框架，用固定虚拟相机替代显式轨迹预测；训练视图条件视频修复模型学习几何先验；设计时空自回归推理管道遍历虚拟相机样条。

Result: 在跨视图视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，该方法在定量指标和定性评估上都优于基于姿态或轨迹的基线方法。

Conclusion: SEE4D通过分离相机控制与场景建模，实现了从随意视频中进行实用4D世界建模的进展。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进Mamba框架的方法，通过Hilbert选择性扫描机制增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，从而更有效地探索特征空间，提升低光图像增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba框架在特征空间探索方面存在不足，需要更好地捕获精细细节和改善空间覆盖，同时减少信息不一致性。

Method: 采用Hilbert选择性扫描机制来增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，优化空间局部性以更好地捕获局部交互，同时保持处理长程依赖的能力。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，该方法显著提升了现有基于Mamba的低光图像增强方法的定量指标和定性视觉保真度，同时减少了计算资源消耗和推理时间。

Conclusion: 这种精炼策略不仅推进了低光图像增强的最新技术水平，而且在利用Mamba技术的更广泛领域中具有应用前景。

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D提升方法主要关注外观生成而忽略内在属性感知，无法生成适用于物理渲染的图形就绪3D场景。

Conclusion: OmniX框架成功将全景2D提升技术推进到生成适用于物理渲染的图形就绪3D场景。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉中的异常检测主要局限于工业缺陷或合成的非真实异常，无法捕捉真实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性，而人类却能自然地识别、推理和解释环境中的异常。

Method: CAVE基准包含细粒度标注，用于视觉定位和基于视觉表现、复杂性、严重性和常见性对异常进行分类，这些标注灵感来源于认知科学研究中人类如何识别和解决异常。

Result: 实验表明，即使采用先进的提示策略，最先进的视觉语言模型在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍然存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE作为一个现实且认知基础扎实的基准，为推进异常检测和视觉语言模型中的常识推理研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了一种在视觉编码器中引入堆叠时间注意力模块的Video-LLM架构，显著提升了视频时序理解能力，在多个基准测试中性能提升达5.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在理解视频复杂时序动态方面存在严重局限，难以处理需要详细理解动作序列和时序进展的任务。

Method: 在视觉编码器中直接引入堆叠时间注意力模块，通过时间注意力机制使模型在将视觉标记传递给LLM之前更好地捕捉动作进展和帧间关系。

Result: 该方法显著改善了时序推理能力，在视频问答任务特别是动作识别方面优于现有模型，在VITATECS、MVBench和Video-MME等基准上提升达5.5%。

Conclusion: 通过在视觉编码器中增强时序结构，解决了Video-LLMs在视频理解方面的关键差距。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决儿科肘部和腕部骨折超声诊断中像素级专家标注耗时耗力的问题，帮助训练不足的用户更自信地进行检查。

Method: 提出FlexICL框架，系统研究图像拼接技术和训练策略，引入新颖的拼接方法，结合多种增强策略实现稳健分割。

Result: 在1252个超声扫描上，比Painter、MAE-VQGAN等最先进模型以及U-Net、TransUNet等传统分割模型的Dice系数提高1-27%。

Conclusion: FlexICL为医学影像中标注数据稀缺的场景提供了高效、可扩展的超声图像分割解决方案。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负提示方法使用固定的负提示，无法根据生成过程中的具体内容进行自适应调整，限制了负引导的效果和灵活性。

Method: 在特定去噪步骤生成中间图像预测，然后查询视觉语言模型来生成上下文相关的负提示，实现动态负提示生成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上评估，展示了负引导强度与文本-图像对齐之间的权衡关系，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 动态负提示方法通过视觉语言模型的自适应能力，能够更有效地控制扩散模型的生成过程，在保持文本一致性的同时提供更好的负引导效果。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PReMA的新型多模态攻击方法，通过仅修改输入图像（不改变提示词）来操纵多模态扩散模型的输出内容，特别是在图像编辑应用中产生不适当内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态扩散模型（如文生图模型）中文本和图像模态的对齐不足，存在生成不适当或NSFW内容的风险，且其对抗输入脆弱性研究不足。

Method: PReMA攻击方法通过创建对抗性图像来操纵模型输出，区别于以往主要生成对抗性提示词的方法。该方法在图像修复和风格迁移等固定提示词的应用中特别有效。

Result: 在多种模型的图像修复和风格迁移任务上的综合评估证实了PReMA的强大效能，能够成功操纵生成内容。

Conclusion: PReMA对多模态扩散模型的完整性构成了新颖威胁，特别是在使用固定提示词的图像编辑应用中，突显了模型安全性的重要研究需求。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Motivation: 研究视频LLM在不同视角下对同一事件的时间理解是否一致，现有模型在跨视角一致性方面表现不佳。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准，包含同步的自我中心和他中心视频对；提出View-GRPO强化学习框架，增强特定视角的时间推理并促进跨视角一致性理解。

Result: 现有视频LLM在跨视角一致性方面表现远差于单视角性能；View-GRPO方法在提升跨视角一致性方面优于朴素SFT和GRPO。

Conclusion: 跨视角时间理解一致性是视频LLM的重要挑战，View-GRPO框架能有效提升模型在跨视角场景下的表现。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文研究面临两大挑战：复杂的多任务解释流程，以及信息组织和检索效率低下。学者需要花费大量时间搜索、整理和管理相关资源。

Method: 构建了包含140万单字拓片图像和8万条释文的多模态知识库，开发OracleAgent系统整合多种甲骨文分析工具，利用大语言模型灵活编排这些组件。

Result: 实验表明OracleAgent在多模态推理和生成任务上表现优异，超越主流MLLMs（如GPT-4o）。案例研究证实能有效协助领域专家，显著降低研究时间成本。

Conclusion: OracleAgent是甲骨文辅助研究和自动化解释系统实用化部署的重要进展，为古代文化遗产研究提供了高效的技术支持。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

TL;DR: 提出联合优化3D高斯点和相机姿态的统一框架，无需预校准输入，通过交替优化策略同时提升场景重建质量和姿态精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法依赖外部相机姿态估计工具（如COLMAP），存在计算瓶颈和误差传播问题，需要消除对预校准输入的依赖。

Method: 将联合优化解耦为两个交替阶段：固定姿态下通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数；使用结合几何和光度约束的自定义3D光流算法优化相机姿态。

Result: 在多个数据集上的评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有无COLMAP技术，并普遍超越基于COLMAP的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的联合优化框架有效解决了传统方法在大视角变化和稀疏特征场景中的投影误差问题，实现了高质量的新视角合成。

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Motivation: 当前端到端驾驶基准主要关注常规场景，无法充分测试系统在罕见长尾情况下的性能，且现有评估指标难以有效评估多模态驾驶行为。

Method: 构建了包含罕见场景的WOD-E2E数据集，并提出Rater Feedback Score (RFS)评估指标，通过评分者标注的轨迹偏好标签来评估预测轨迹的质量。

Result: 发布了包含4021个驾驶片段的数据集，覆盖发生频率低于0.03%的罕见场景，并提供了验证集的评分者偏好标签。

Conclusion: WOD-E2E数据集和RFS指标旨在推动可泛化、鲁棒且安全的端到端自动驾驶研究，使其能够处理复杂的真实世界情况。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然注意力模型在多个领域取得显著进展，但将基于梯度的注意力信息直接集成到CNN表示中以进行语义对象理解的应用仍然有限。这种集成对于视觉任务如SLAM特别有益，因为增强空间注意力对象位置的CNN表示可以提高性能。

Method: 利用任务特定的网络注意力，将来自网络梯度的逐层注意力信息与CNN特征表示相结合，以改进帧关联性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线方法相比性能有所提升，特别是在大型环境中表现更好。

Conclusion: 将基于梯度的注意力信息集成到CNN表示中可以有效提升RGB-D室内SLAM系统的性能，尤其是在大规模环境中。

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

Motivation: 现有的3D部件生成方法存在两个问题：隐式向量集表示缺乏几何细节，而显式体素表示共享全局网格导致小部件分辨率不足。需要结合两种范式的优势来生成高质量的详细部件。

Method: 1) 使用隐式向量集扩散生成边界框布局；2) 在每个部件的固定完整分辨率体素网格中生成详细几何；3) 引入中心点编码策略解决不同大小部件间的信息对齐问题。

Conclusion: FullPart通过结合隐式和显式表示的优势，解决了3D部件生成中的细节不足问题，同时构建了最大的PartVerse-XL数据集，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CRAG-MM基准测试，包含6.5K图像-问题-答案三元组和2K多轮对话，覆盖13个领域，专门针对可穿戴设备场景的多模态检索增强生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对可穿戴设备场景的全面多模态RAG基准测试，需要填补这一空白以支持智能眼镜等设备的实体信息查询需求。

Method: 构建包含多样化图像质量问题、问题类型、实体流行度、信息动态性和对话轮次的基准数据集，设计三个任务：单源增强、多源增强和多轮对话。

Result: 现有RAG方法在单轮和多轮QA上的真实性分别仅为32%和43%，行业解决方案质量相似（32%/45%），表明有巨大改进空间。KDD Cup 2025获胜方案将基线性能提升了28%。

Conclusion: CRAG-MM基准测试为多模态RAG研究提供了重要工具，揭示了当前方法的局限性，并已通过竞赛推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于扩散模型的高分辨率运动轨迹估计框架MoTDiff，能从单张运动模糊图像中估计高质量的运动轨迹，在图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有从单张模糊图像提取运动信息的方法（如模糊核和光流）质量较低，表现为粗粒度且不准确，需要高分辨率、高质量的运动轨迹估计方法。

Method: MoTDiff包含两个关键组件：1）使用从单张模糊图像提取的多尺度特征图作为条件的条件扩散框架；2）新的训练方法，能促进精确识别细粒度运动轨迹、一致估计运动路径的整体形状和位置，以及沿运动轨迹的像素连通性。

Result: 实验表明MoTDiff在盲图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MoTDiff框架能够从单张运动模糊图像中估计出高质量的高分辨率运动轨迹，在相关应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

TL;DR: ConceptScope是一个可扩展的自动化框架，使用稀疏自编码器从视觉基础模型中提取人类可解释的概念，用于发现和量化数据集中的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习数据集中普遍存在数据集偏见，但系统性地识别这些偏见需要昂贵的人工标注，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 基于视觉基础模型表示训练稀疏自编码器，将概念分类为目标、上下文和偏见类型，通过语义相关性和统计相关性分析数据集。

Result: ConceptScope能捕捉广泛的视觉概念，检测已知偏见并发现未标注的新偏见，概念激活产生与语义区域对齐的空间归因。

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了实用工具，能够可靠地识别数据集中的各种偏见。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Conclusion: 通过'从合成中学习'策略和大规模合成数据集，成功开发了高效准确的草图到3D人体姿态估计框架，解决了数据稀缺和泛化能力问题。

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Method: 使用新颖的几何深度网络提出集成深度网络Ch-EGN，这是一种混合卷积和几何深度学习的方法，利用供应链中的信息依赖关系来推导数据库中样本的不可见状态。

Result: 在风险管理的集成网络中获得了98.95%的平均准确率；在可持续供应链方面，5产品组分类获得100%准确率，4产品关系分类获得98.07%准确率，25公司关系分类获得92.37%准确率。

Conclusion: 与最先进方法相比，所提出的方法在平均改进和效率方面表现出优越性，证实了其在供应链风险管理和可持续性提升中的有效性。

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档布局生成研究不足，现有数据集主要局限于学术论文的Manhattan风格布局，缺乏报纸、杂志等开放世界文档类型的多样性。

Method: 构建OmniLayout-1M数据集覆盖6种文档类型，提出OmniLayout-LLM模型采用两阶段学习：1）从粗粒度类别学习通用布局原则，2）向特定领域迁移知识。

Result: 在M$^{6}$Doc数据集上多个领域表现优异，显著超越现有布局生成专家和最新通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M和OmniLayout-LLM为文档布局生成提供了有效解决方案，填补了多样化布局生成的空白。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务上表现出色，但对视频中时间信息的理解和评估仍然薄弱且不足。作者旨在探索这一差距，通过判断时间方向这一简单但具有揭示性的挑战来评估模型的时间推理能力。

Method: 引入AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，使用与人类相同的刺激和行为基线来测试VLMs推断自然视频时间方向的能力。对开放权重和专有、推理和非推理VLMs进行全面评估。

Result: 大多数模型表现接近随机水平，即使在物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动动作（如除法/加法）等人类几乎能立即识别的任务上，最佳模型也远远落后于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统存在根本性差距：虽然它们能够捕捉丰富的视觉-语义相关性，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏差。作者发布代码和数据以促进VLMs物理和时间推理能力的进一步发展。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Result: 在多个数据集上的定性和定量评估中达到最先进的融合性能，显著提升语义分割指标。

Conclusion: 基于人类认知启发的生成式图像融合方法在增强结构一致性和细节质量方面具有优势。

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Result: ResNet50单独表现最佳，但三种网络融合后性能显著提升。热图显示不同网络关注图像的不同区域，解释了它们的互补性。该方法在UBIPr数据库上超越了先前工作。

Conclusion: 不同CNN架构在眼周验证中具有互补性，网络融合策略能显著提升性能，为眼周生物特征识别提供了新的最优方法。

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法存在模式坍塌问题，无法生成多样化轨迹假设；而生成方法难以在生成过程中直接融入安全和物理约束，需要额外优化阶段。

Method: 采用约束流匹配方法，显式建模流匹配过程，在流匹配过程中直接施加约束，并将驾驶激进性参数化为控制信号。

Result: 在NavSim v2挑战赛中获得第二名，EPDMS得分为51.31，并获得创新奖。

Conclusion: CATG框架有效解决了自动驾驶规划中的模式坍塌和约束整合问题，能够生成多样化且符合安全约束的轨迹。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

Motivation: 研究眼周生物识别技术，该区域具有高区分度和最小采集约束的优势，旨在评估深度学习模型在大规模眼周数据集上的表现。

Method: 使用三种不同深度和复杂度的卷积神经网络架构，在包含1,907,572张眼部裁剪图像的大规模VGGFace2数据库上进行训练，并在VGGFace2-Pose和UFPR-Periocular两个数据集上进行实验评估。

Result: 在非受控条件的VGGFace2数据集上，眼部裁剪图像的等错误率为9-15%，而全脸图像的等错误率为3-6%。在UFPR-Periocular数据集上取得了1-2%的等错误率，这是该数据集上目前报告的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 眼周生物识别在高质量图像和一致采集协议下能取得优异性能，但在非受控条件下性能会显著下降。使用大规模训练数据可以提升模型性能，在UFPR数据集上取得了当前最佳结果。

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Conclusion: AEOS-Bench是首个面向真实星座调度的大规模基准套件，AEOS-Former为AEOS星座调度提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是导致中老年人视力丧失的主要原因，现有基于单一CNN或ViT骨干网络的方法性能已达瓶颈，需要整合不同骨干网络的优势来进一步提升诊断性能。

Method: 提出证据融合范式，通过深度证据网络将CNN和ViT提取的特征转化为支持证据，形成聚合意见来自适应调整不同骨干网络间的融合模式。

Result: 在两个公开DR分级数据集上的实验结果表明，该混合模型不仅提高了DR分级的准确性，相比最先进框架表现更优，还为特征融合和决策提供了出色的可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于证据理论的融合范式能有效整合CNN和ViT骨干网络的各自优势，提升糖尿病视网膜病变诊断性能，同时提供良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

### [42] [GLYPH-SR: Can We Achieve Both High-Quality Image Super-Resolution and High-Fidelity Text Recovery via VLM-guided Latent Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26339)
*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR是一个视觉语言引导的扩散框架，专门针对图像超分辨率中的场景文本恢复问题，通过结合文本可读性和感知质量优化，显著提升OCR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率方法主要关注失真指标（PSNR/SSIM）或感知质量指标，但对字符级错误不敏感。场景文本（如标志、产品标签）包含最关键信息，但现有方法往往将其视为普通纹理处理，导致OCR识别失败。

Method: GLYPH-SR采用文本-SR融合控制网络（TS-ControlNet）结合OCR数据引导，以及乒乓调度器在文本中心和场景中心指导之间交替。在合成语料库上训练这些组件，同时保持主SR分支冻结。

Result: 在SVT、SCUT-CTW1500和CUTE80数据集上，4倍和8倍超分辨率下，GLYPH-SR相比扩散/GAN基线将OCR F1分数提升了高达15.18个百分点（SVT x8, OpenOCR），同时保持了竞争力的MANIQA、CLIP-IQA和MUSIQ分数。

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR能够同时实现高可读性和高视觉真实感，提供既看起来正确又读起来正确的超分辨率结果。

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合EEG嵌入和空间显著性图的双条件框架，通过ATM提取EEG特征，使用LoRA微调Stable Diffusion 2.1，并利用ControlNet分支进行空间控制，显著提升了EEG驱动图像重建的质量和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG驱动图像重建方法往往忽视空间注意机制，限制了重建图像的保真度和语义连贯性。

Method: 采用双条件框架：1) 使用ATM提取EEG特征；2) 通过LoRA微调Stable Diffusion 2.1对齐神经信号与视觉语义；3) 使用ControlNet分支基于显著性图进行空间控制。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG数据集上评估，相比现有方法在低层和高层图像特征质量上取得显著提升，同时与人类视觉注意高度对齐。

Conclusion: 注意先验能够解决EEG的模糊性，实现高保真重建，在医学诊断和神经自适应接口中具有应用前景，通过预训练扩散模型的高效适应推进了神经解码技术。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LoCoT2V-Bench基准，专门用于评估复杂输入条件下的长视频生成，包含多维度评估框架和新指标，发现现有方法在事件一致性、细粒度对齐和主题遵循方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成的评估基准主要依赖简化提示和低层次指标，忽视了与提示的细粒度对齐以及叙事连贯性、主题表达等抽象维度，特别是在处理复杂提示和长视频生成方面存在挑战。

Method: 基于真实世界视频构建了包含场景转换和事件动态等元素的复杂提示集，建立了多维度评估框架，包括事件级对齐、细粒度时间一致性、内容清晰度和人类期望实现度(HERD)等新指标。

Result: 对9个代表性长视频生成模型的评估显示，现有方法在基本视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高层次主题遵循等方面存在困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长形式复杂文本到视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，并指明了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了A-TPT框架，通过引入角度多样性来改善视觉语言模型在测试时提示调优中的校准性能，通过最大化归一化文本特征之间的最小成对角度距离来实现特征分布的均匀性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时提示调优方法在文本特征分散性方面存在不足，导致校准性能不佳，影响了视觉语言模型的可靠性、可信度和安全性。这些方法主要关注最大化平均文本特征分散度或施加正交约束，但忽视了角度多样性的关键作用。

Method: 提出A-TPT框架，通过最大化归一化文本特征在单位超球面上的最小成对角度距离，鼓励学习提示诱导的文本特征分布的均匀性，从而实现角度多样性。

Result: 在各种骨干网络和数据集上的广泛实验表明，A-TPT在减少聚合平均校准误差方面持续优于最先进的TPT方法，同时保持相当的准确性。在自然分布偏移上表现出优越的零样本校准性能，并能很好地泛化到医学数据集。

Conclusion: 促进角度多样性是实现良好分散文本特征的有效方法，能显著改善视觉语言模型在测试时适应过程中的校准性能。理论分析和实验结果都支持A-TPT的有效性。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 将3D重建模型DUSt3R和MASt3R适配用于点跟踪任务，通过3D基础对应关系实现竞争性甚至更优的点跟踪性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用先进的3D重建模型在静态场景中的2D和3D对应能力，将其扩展到动态点跟踪任务

Method: 结合重建损失与动态对应训练，添加可见性头，使用少量合成数据微调MASt3R模型，仅在包含查询点的帧对上进行训练和评估

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或更优的点跟踪结果，在EgoPoints上比CoTracker2提升33.5%，在TAP-Vid-DAVIS上达到73.8 δ_avg/85.8%遮挡精度

Conclusion: 3D重建模型可以成功适配于点跟踪任务，在去除时间上下文的情况下仍能实现优异的跟踪性能

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

TL;DR: 提出了FineGrainedAD框架，通过多级细粒度语义描述和语义对齐机制，解决了少样本异常检测中语义不对齐问题，在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上取得了优越性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有少样本异常检测方法依赖预训练视觉语言模型，但由于缺乏详细文本描述，只能预定义图像级描述来匹配视觉补丁，导致图像描述与补丁级视觉异常之间的语义不对齐，定位性能不佳。

Method: 提出多级细粒度语义描述(MFSC)为异常检测数据集提供多级细粒度文本描述，并基于此构建FineGrainedAD框架，包含多级可学习提示(MLLP)和多级语义对齐(MLSA)两个组件。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的实验表明，FineGrainedAD在少样本设置下实现了优越的整体性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入多级细粒度语义描述和语义对齐机制，有效解决了少样本异常检测中的语义不对齐问题，显著提升了异常定位性能。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中对象-上下文关联偏差问题，这种偏差会降低模型在测试场景与训练共现模式不同时的零样本可靠性。

Method: 将问题重构为因果推理问题，在CLIP表示空间中估计对象和背景期望，通过重新组合对象特征与来自外部数据集、批次邻居或文本描述的多样化替代上下文来合成反事实嵌入。

Result: 在上下文敏感基准测试中显著提高了最差组和平均准确率，建立了新的零样本最先进水平，无需重新训练或提示设计。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个轻量级的表示级反事实框架，为去偏和可靠的多模态推理提供了一条实用的因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 通过头尾数据重新平衡策略，可以有效缓解自我改进过程中的马太效应，显著提升模型的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

Motivation: 传统广告制作需要手动从长视频广告中选择和重新编辑镜头来创建不同时长的版本，这个过程劳动密集且耗时。

Method: 开发了一个双流音视频融合模型，预测视频帧的重要性，其中重要性定义为帧在公司制作的短广告中被选中的可能性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将视频剪辑作为镜头选择问题来处理，特别强调音频在广告中的重要性，并通过音视频融合模型取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATCH是一个即插即用的跨域适应框架，通过轻量级域分类器和双适配器机制提升VQA模型在遥感、医疗、数学图表等域外场景的泛化能力，无需重新训练骨干模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但在域外场景（如遥感、医疗、数学图表）中泛化能力显著下降，现有方法依赖按域微调或定制化流程，成本高且不灵活。

Method: 提出CATCH框架，通过域分类器识别输入图像类型，使用包含提示适配器和视觉适配器的双适配器机制，通过统一钩子接口动态注入，实现视觉和语言适应的解耦。

Result: 在四个域特定VQA基准测试中取得一致性能提升：MathVQA上BLEU提升2.3，MedVQA-RAD上VQA得分提升2.6，ChartQA上ROUGE提升3.1。

Conclusion: CATCH提供了一个可扩展的多域VQA方法，能够在不同应用领域实现实际部署，无需重新训练骨干模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

TL;DR: ResMatching是一种新的计算超分辨率方法，使用引导条件流匹配学习数据先验，在BioSR数据集上表现优异，在数据保真度和感知真实性之间达到最佳平衡，并能提供像素级不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算超分辨率在荧光显微镜中是一个不适定问题，核心在于找到能够外推显微镜未成像频率的先验。随着数据驱动的机器学习技术发展，可以学习更强的先验来获得更好的超分辨率结果。

Method: ResMatching使用引导条件流匹配来学习改进的数据先验，能够从隐式学习的后验分布中采样，并提供像素级数据不确定性估计。

Result: 在BioSR数据集的4种不同生物结构上评估，与7个基线方法比较，ResMatching始终取得有竞争力的结果，在所有情况下都展现出数据保真度和感知真实性的最佳权衡。在低分辨率图像噪声较多、强先验难以学习的情况下特别有效。

Conclusion: ResMatching是一种有效的计算超分辨率方法，能够学习改进的数据先验，提供校准的后验分布采样和像素级不确定性估计，为未来用户提供拒绝不确定预测的指导。

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了专门为事件相机设计的Spiking Patches分词器，通过事件标记化来保持事件流的异步性和空间稀疏性，相比传统的帧和体素表示，在保持精度的同时显著提升了推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件表示方法（帧和体素）虽然精度高，但破坏了事件相机的异步性和空间稀疏性特征，需要一种能保持这些独特属性的新表示方法。

Method: 提出Spiking Patches分词器，将异步稀疏的事件流转换为标记表示，并在手势识别和物体检测任务中使用GNN、PCN和Transformer进行评估。

Result: Spiking Patches标记比体素标记推理速度快3.4倍，比帧快10.4倍，同时精度相当甚至在某些情况下有所提升（手势识别提升3.8%，物体检测提升1.4%）。

Conclusion: 事件标记化为事件视觉提供了新方向，是朝着保持事件相机特性的方法迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Abstract: To address the challenges in UAV object detection, such as complex
backgrounds, severe occlusion, dense small objects, and varying lighting
conditions,this paper proposes PT-DETR based on RT-DETR, a novel detection
algorithm specifically designed for small objects in UAV imagery. In the

Furthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box

thereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. Compared with
RT-DETR, our PT-DETR achieves mAP improvements of 1.6% and 1.7% on the

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

TL;DR: 本文首次大规模评估了48种深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰影像上的表现，多个模型实现了亚公里级精度（300-400米），证明了深度学习光流方法可以有效应用于极地遥感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计海冰漂移对北极航行、气候研究和业务预报至关重要。虽然光流技术在计算机视觉领域发展迅速，但其在地球物理问题和卫星SAR影像中的应用仍待探索。

Method: 使用48种深度学习光流模型处理RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰影像，通过端点误差(EPE)和Fl指标进行评估，并与GNSS跟踪浮标数据进行对比验证。

Result: 多个模型达到亚公里级精度（EPE 6-8像素，300-400米），相对于海冰运动的空间尺度和北极典型导航需求而言误差很小。模型能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法相比传统方法显著提高了运动估计精度，可以有效迁移到极地遥感中，提供空间连续的漂移场，为导航和气候建模提供新的机会。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Result: 在具有部分遮挡的挑战性数据集上，相比基线方法在召回率和精确率上都有整体提升。训练时同时使用遮挡和非遮挡图像效果最好。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可解释性，易于适应其他数据集，为未来研究和实际应用提供了多个方向。

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

Conclusion: SteerVLM提供了一种有效的推理时控制方法，无需修改模型权重即可实现细粒度语义控制，同时引入了VNIA数据集来支持VLM引导技术的开发与评估。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

Result: 对多个最新VLMs的评估揭示了它们在图表理解中的感知偏差、弱点、鲁棒性和幻觉问题，发现了模型间的细粒度差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果指出了当前模型在图表理解任务中需要加强的具体技能，为改进VLMs的图表理解能力提供了方向。

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型在泛化能力上存在瓶颈，而视频生成领域在建模人类行为方面展现出卓越的泛化能力，这为运动生成提供了可借鉴的见解。

Method: 1) 构建ViMoGen-228K大规模数据集，整合高质量光学动捕数据、网络视频语义标注动作和视频生成模型合成样本；2) 提出基于流匹配的扩散变换器ViMoGen，通过门控多模态条件统一动捕数据和视频生成模型的先验；3) 开发轻量版ViMoGen-light，消除视频生成依赖但保持强泛化能力；4) 建立分层评估基准MBench。

Conclusion: 通过系统地从视频生成迁移知识到运动生成，该框架在数据、建模和评估三个关键支柱上实现了显著改进，为3D人体运动生成提供了更强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 解决全球尺度图像地理定位的挑战：标准图像检索方法在大规模图像下效率低，且当覆盖不足时会失效；现有可扩展方案存在粗粒度分类或跨视图检索的领域差距问题。

Method: 使用代理分类任务训练学习丰富特征表示，隐式编码精确位置信息；结合航空影像嵌入提高对地面数据稀疏性的鲁棒性；实现跨多国地区的直接细粒度检索。

Result: 在覆盖欧洲大部分地区的数据集上，超过68%的查询能够在200米范围内准确定位。

Conclusion: 该方法在大地理范围内实现了细粒度地理定位，通过结合学习原型和航空影像嵌入，有效解决了地面数据稀疏性问题，代码已公开。

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为掩码扩散字幕（MDC）的方法，通过图像条件掩码扩散语言模型学习视觉特征。该方法在训练时随机掩码图像-字幕对中的文本标记，训练基于视觉特征的解码器重建原始文本，学到的视觉特征可用于下游视觉任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归字幕方法中视觉学习信号强度依赖于标记在序列中位置的问题，减少对辅助目标的需求，提供更均衡的视觉特征学习。

Method: 使用图像条件掩码扩散语言模型，随机掩码图像字幕对中的文本标记，训练视觉条件解码器重建原始文本，从而学习视觉特征。

Result: 在各种学术规模模型和数据集上的线性探测实验表明，该方法学到的视觉特征与自回归和对比方法相当。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散字幕方法能够有效学习视觉特征，在减少辅助目标需求的同时，达到与现有方法竞争的性能。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

TL;DR: 对领先视频生成模型Veo-3在12个维度上的零样本推理能力进行实证研究，发现其在短时空间连贯性和局部动态一致性方面表现良好，但在长时因果推理和严格几何约束方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视频生成模型是否能够作为零样本推理器在复杂视觉推理场景中发挥作用，评估其世界知识编码能力和推理潜力。

Method: 创建MME-CoF基准测试，系统评估视频模型在空间、几何、物理、时间和具身逻辑等12个维度的推理行为，分析其优势和失败模式。

Result: 当前视频模型在短时空间连贯性、细粒度定位和局部一致动态方面显示出有前景的推理模式，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面仍有限制。

Conclusion: 视频模型尚不能作为独立的零样本推理器，但可作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎，展现出令人鼓舞的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出StructLayoutFormer，一种基于Transformer的条件结构化布局生成方法，能够生成明确的布局结构而非固定布局


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法能自动生成固定布局但无法产生布局结构，而结构化布局在2D视觉内容中更受欢迎，便于布局编辑

Method: 使用结构序列化方案将结构化布局表示为序列，将结构信息与元素放置解耦，基于Transformer架构

Result: 在条件结构化布局生成任务中超越现有基线方法，并能有效提取和传输布局结构

Conclusion: 这是首个实现条件结构化布局生成的数据驱动方法，能够生成明确的现实布局结构

Abstract: Structured layouts are preferable in many 2D visual contents (\eg, GUIs,
webpages) since the structural information allows convenient layout editing.
Computational frameworks can help create structured layouts but require heavy
labor input. Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically
generating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present
StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional
structured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to
represent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of
generated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element
placements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves
conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout
structures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout
generation approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.
Extensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in
conditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach
is effective in extracting and transferring layout structures. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前国际象棋引擎提供精确但不透明的评估分数，这些输出掩盖了单个棋子或模式的贡献。需要一种方法来解释引擎评估背后的具体因素。

Method: 将棋子视为特征，通过系统性地移除棋子并计算SHAP值，获得每个棋子对引擎评估的加性贡献，该方法受到传统国际象棋教学中移除棋子分析方法的启发。

Result: 开发了一种能够以局部忠实和人类可解释的方式解释引擎输出的方法，为可视化、人类训练和引擎比较开辟了新可能性。

Conclusion: 该方法将现代可解释AI技术与传统国际象棋分析方法相结合，发布了相关代码和数据以促进可解释国际象棋AI的未来研究。

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在基于GPT-4o的侦探游戏中，约束提示对玩家体验的影响。研究发现高约束提示并未显著改善体验，反而揭示了角色依赖的支架效应：采访者NPC获得稳定性，而嫌疑人NPC失去即兴可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索约束提示是否真正改善玩家体验，因为虽然LLMs承诺通过非玩家角色实现非脚本对话，但约束提示的实际效果尚不明确。

Method: 采用被试内可用性研究（N=10）比较高约束提示（HCP）和低约束提示（LCP），然后重新设计HCP为混合JSON+RAG支架，并使用LLM法官进行合成评估。

Result: 结果显示没有可靠的经验差异，但发现支架效应具有角色依赖性：采访者NPC获得稳定性，嫌疑人NPC失去即兴可信度。

Conclusion: 研究推翻了更严格约束必然增强游戏性的假设，提出了符号支架游戏框架，其中符号结构表达为模糊数值边界，在需要时稳定连贯性，同时保留维持参与度的即兴元素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

Motivation: LLM作为评估器在主观任务中可靠性有限，人类判断涉及超出标注标签的微妙推理，思维轨迹信息丰富但难以收集。

Method: 使用人机协作框架和拒绝采样方法从标签标注中推断思维轨迹，应用于微调开源LLM评估器和改进专有LLM评估器的标注指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提高了LLM与人类的一致性，改进的标注指南增加了不同LLM模型间的一致性。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为人类思维轨迹的实用代理，将仅标签语料库扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，提升LLM评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两层级框架来解释为什么压缩过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。信息论必要性(ITI)建立了生存压力与信息处理需求之间的联系，压缩效率原则(CEP)解释了高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态选择生成性因果模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架都认同压缩对智能的核心作用，但未能具体说明为什么这个过程会强制发现因果结构而不是表面统计模式。作者旨在填补这一空白，提供一个统一的理论框架。

Method: 引入两层级框架：信息论必要性(ITI)从进化角度解释生存压力如何导致信息处理需求；压缩效率原则(CEP)从机制上解释高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态选择因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生了可实证检验的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化相关；异常积累率可区分因果模型和相关模型；分层系统在不同抽象层级上表现出递增效率；生物系统展示了与表征复杂性相关的代谢成本。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP提供了一个统一框架，解释了生物、人工和多尺度系统中智能的收敛现象，涵盖了智能的认识论和功能维度，无需诉诸意识或主观经验的假设。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模多样化的基于角色的偏好，为解决LLM评委与人类偏好对齐问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

Result: 在Q1-Q500测试集上，GPT-4o得分为73.5%，Humans-Junior为72.7%，差异仅为0.8个百分点，在±5%范围内达到等效。前沿模型的提示优化也带来显著提升。

Conclusion: 小型模型通过适当的推理支架和行为微调，可以在特定任务上达到大型模型的性能水平，同时大幅降低成本，为边缘部署和经济高效的AI应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了注意力感知逆规划问题，旨在从人类行为中推断认知偏差，特别是注意力偏差。通过结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模，在真实驾驶场景中证明了该方法的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类的目标导向行为受到认知偏差的影响，与人类交互的自主系统需要意识到这一点。例如，人们在日常任务（如驾驶）中会因注意力偏差而系统性地影响行为表现。

Method: 结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模，提出注意力感知逆规划方法，用于从行为中推断注意力策略和认知偏差。

Result: 在Waymo开放数据集中的真实驾驶场景中成功推断RL智能体的注意力策略，证明了注意力感知逆规划在估计认知偏差方面的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划与标准逆强化学习有系统性差异，能够有效推断认知偏差，为构建更理解人类行为的自主系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于代理的自然语言转SQL系统，通过Mistral ReAct代理协调多个工具来处理复杂的时空查询，相比单纯的SQL生成器显著提高了准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL-to-SQL系统在处理现实时空查询时表现不佳，需要解决用户模糊表达与数据库特定类别的对齐、时间推理和输出选择等问题，以帮助非SQL专家用户更自然地与数据库交互。

Method: 扩展了基础的文本转SQL模型(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b)，通过Mistral ReAct代理进行编排，代理能够规划、分解和调整查询，使用模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具。

Result: 在35个针对NYC和东京签到数据集的自然语言查询测试中，代理系统达到91.4%的准确率，显著高于基线模型的28.6%，并通过地图、图表和结构化自然语言摘要提升了可用性。

Conclusion: 代理编排而非仅依赖更强的SQL生成器，是构建交互式地理空间助手的有前景的基础，能够支持缺乏SQL专业知识、详细模式知识或提示技能的用户。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

TL;DR: StuckSolver是一个基于大语言模型的自动驾驶车辆卡滞恢复框架，通过自主推理和乘客引导决策解决车辆卡滞问题，无需修改现有系统架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通场景中容易卡滞，而远程干预成本高、人工接管限制非驾驶员使用，现有恢复方案不足。

Method: 作为插件模块运行在现有感知-规划-控制栈之上，利用传感器数据检测卡滞状态，通过LLM进行环境理解并生成高层恢复指令。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试和自定义不确定性场景中，仅通过自主推理就达到接近最优性能，结合乘客引导后表现更佳。

Conclusion: StuckSolver提供了一种有效且可扩展的自动驾驶车辆卡滞恢复解决方案，无需修改现有系统架构。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨AI问责性的重要性，提出了AI应具备可被质疑、讨论和制裁的能力，并探索了实现AI问责的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力的迅速增强，为确保AI服务于消费者、选民和决策者的需求，必须使AI具备问责性。当前许多AI系统缺乏问责机制，无法被质疑、讨论或制裁。

Method: 将通用问责定义应用于AI领域，阐述AI问责与不问责的含义，探索提高AI问责性的方法途径。

Result: 明确了AI问责性的概念框架，识别了当前AI系统在问责性方面的不足，提出了改善AI问责性的方向。

Conclusion: 构建所有AI都对受其影响者负责的世界是必要的，需要持续探索实现AI问责的具体方法。

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4

best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model

and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化中的不足，提出了GUI知识的三维框架，并创建了GUI知识基准来评估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化方面仍落后于人类，作者认为这是由于缺乏核心GUI知识，而现有的训练方法无法完全解决这个问题。

Method: 通过分析GUI任务执行中的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度：界面感知、交互预测和指令理解，并创建了涵盖6个平台、292个应用的GUI知识基准。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs能识别小部件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面存在困难。真实世界GUI任务实验验证了GUI知识与任务成功之间的紧密联系。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估GUI知识提供了结构化框架，支持在下游训练前选择潜力更大的VLMs，并为构建更强大的GUI代理提供了见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Motivation: 大语言模型的推理成本已成为决定其商业可行性和广泛应用的关键因素，需要建立经济分析框架来指导模型部署决策。

Method: 构建量化推理经济学框架，将LLM推理过程视为计算驱动的智能生产活动，分析边际成本、规模经济和输出质量，基于WiNEval-3.0数据进行实证分析。

Conclusion: 为模型部署决策提供了经济基础，并为未来AI推理资源的市场定价和优化奠定了实证基础。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Motivation: 当前强化学习主要关注数学和代码领域，需要开发能够跨领域迁移推理能力的通用方法。

Method: 两阶段课程学习：阶段1在数学领域进行强化学习，阶段2在混合领域进行联合强化学习以迁移和巩固推理技能。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B模型上的多领域评估显示一致性能提升，消融实验证明两个阶段都必要。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一种紧凑、易用的通用推理训练方法，数学优先的训练策略能增强解决复杂问题所需的认知行为。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI
research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert
guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization,
3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅适用于训练目标，还能泛化到更广泛的评判任务，包括Best-of-N采样和自校正，为未来研究提供了数据和模型检查点。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虽然有大量问卷调查数据，但大语言模型在处理这种结构化问卷数据方面的能力尚未充分探索。现有的调查分析工具主要为人工作业设计，缺乏与LLM和AI自动化的有效集成，导致研究人员和用户缺乏如何最佳表示问卷数据供LLM使用的指导。

Method: 引入QASU基准，评估六种结构技能（包括答案查找、受访者计数和多跳推理），测试六种序列化格式和多种提示策略。通过系统隔离格式和提示效果，使用自增强提示等方法进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，选择有效的格式和提示组合相比次优格式可以将准确率提高8.8个百分点。对于特定任务，通过自增强提示添加轻量级结构提示可以平均再提高3-4个百分点。

Conclusion: QASU基准为基于LLM的问卷分析研究和实际应用提供了一个简单而多功能的基础，通过系统评估格式和提示策略，为优化问卷数据处理提供了实证指导。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: GEPO通过构建状态转移图并利用图论中心性来解决多轮交互LLM智能体训练中的结构盲问题，在三个基准测试中显著提升了成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于群体的强化学习方法在多轮交互LLM智能体训练中存在结构盲问题，无法利用环境的基础连接性，导致探索效率低、信用分配不准确和规划短视。

Method: GEPO从智能体经验中动态构建状态转移图，并利用图论中心性提供三种协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励、图增强优势函数和动态折扣因子。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，GEPO相比竞争基线分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模环境结构是推进LLM智能体训练的鲁棒且可泛化的策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance是一个将法规文本表示为策略图、运行时上下文表示为上下文图并进行对齐的框架，用于解决网络规模合规性评估的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络规模的合规性评估面临实际挑战：每个请求都需要进行法规评估。法规文本具有交叉引用和规范性特点，而运行时上下文是非结构化的自然语言，需要将非结构化文本中的语义信息与结构化法规元素对齐。

Method: 引入GraphCompliance框架，将法规文本表示为策略图（编码规范结构和交叉引用），将运行时上下文表示为上下文图（形式化事件为主谓宾三元组和实体关系三元组），并对齐这两个图。这种对齐使法官大语言模型的推理基于结构化信息，减少法规解释和事件解析的负担。

Result: 在300个GDPR衍生的真实场景实验中，GraphCompliance在五个评估任务上比仅使用LLM和RAG基线获得4.1-7.2个百分点的micro-F1提升，具有更少的欠预测和过预测，导致更高的召回率和更低的误报率。

Conclusion: 消融研究表明每个图组件都有贡献，表明结构化表示和法官LLM对于规范推理是互补的。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出IPA-UCT方法，通过弱化状态抽象条件来提升MCTS的样本效率，在多种测试领域和迭代预算下优于OGA-UCT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCTS状态抽象方法在噪声或大动作空间设置中几乎找不到状态抽象，限制了样本效率的提升。

Method: 提出IPA-UCT方法，使用较弱的抽象条件（IPA框架）来平衡精度损失与抽象数量，并建立更通用的p-ASAP框架。

Result: IPA-UCT在大量测试领域和迭代预算下表现优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。

Conclusion: IPA-UCT通过弱化抽象条件有效解决了状态抽象稀缺问题，为MCTS提供了更实用的抽象方法。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

TL;DR: BOTS是一个用于LLM强化微调的贝叶斯在线任务选择框架，通过自适应维护任务难度后验估计，结合显式和隐式证据，使用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用，显著提升数据效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化微调方法在任务选择上存在效率问题：均匀采样浪费计算资源在简单或不可解任务上，而现有选择方法存在高成本、适应性差或证据不完整的问题。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推理框架，自适应维护任务难度后验估计；联合使用直接评估的显式证据和从评估中推断未选择任务的隐式证据；通过Thompson采样平衡探索与利用；使用超轻量插值插件估计未评估任务难度。

Result: 在多个领域和不同规模的LLM上，BOTS相比基线方法和消融实验，持续提升了数据效率和性能表现。

Conclusion: BOTS为RFT中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够有效提升强化微调的效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模型性能选择基准测试子集的方法成本高、无法处理新基准测试（冷启动问题），且假设未来模型与现有模型有相似失败模式存在局限性

Method: 采用项目中心方法，基于任务项目的内在认知需求进行数据选择，开发Scales++方法实现这一理念

Result: Scales++将前期选择成本降低18倍以上，使用仅0.5%数据子集在Open LLM Leaderboard上预测完整基准测试分数，平均绝对误差为2.9%

Conclusion: 项目中心方法能够实现更高效的模型评估，同时提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

Motivation: 随着代理型AI的出现，将引发新型人格的"寒武纪大爆发"，需要实用框架来应对这种多样化，而不陷入关于AI意识或理性的无解辩论。

Method: 将传统人格义务束解绑，为不同情境创建定制解决方案；利用去中心化数字身份技术；探讨"人格作为问题"和"人格作为解决方案"的双重角色。

Result: 提供了一种无需解决AI意识辩论就能创建实用工具（如促进AI合约、创建可制裁的"个体"）的方法；展示了如何通过赋予义务束来确保问责或防止冲突。

Conclusion: 通过拒绝寻找单一本质定义的基础主义追求，本文提供了一种更实用、灵活的方式来思考将AI代理整合到社会中的问题。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

TL;DR: Autograder+是一个AI驱动的编程教育评估系统，通过微调大语言模型生成教学对齐的自动化反馈，并使用对比学习代码嵌入进行可视化聚类分析，将传统总结性评分转变为形成性学习体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编程教育的快速发展超出了传统评估工具的能力，教师缺乏提供有意义、可扩展反馈的手段。传统自动评分器作为黑盒系统仅返回通过/失败结果，无法洞察学生思维或学习需求。

Method: 系统采用微调的大语言模型生成自动化反馈，模型在精选的学生代码和专家反馈上进行训练；使用对比学习代码嵌入对1000个标注提交进行训练，实现基于功能和方法的解决方案聚类；支持提示池功能，让教师通过选择提示模板指导反馈风格。

Result: 在600个学生提交的评估中，系统生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐；可视化功能能够将解决方案按功能和方法进行有意义的聚类分组。

Conclusion: 通过整合AI驱动反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，Autograder+在减少教师工作量的同时支持针对性教学，促进更好的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA

achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a

Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型通过增加推理时间计算来提高任务性能，且先前研究认为这种扩展推理可能增强安全性，但作者发现同样的推理机制可被用来绕过安全防护。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击方法，将有害请求与长序列的无害谜题推理过程结合，通过稀释安全检查信号来绕过模型的安全机制。

Result: 在HarmBench基准测试中，该方法在Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet上的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超之前的越狱方法。

Conclusion: 最可解释的推理形式——显式思维链，在与最终答案线索结合时，本身可能成为越狱攻击的载体。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在社会影响下的从众行为，特别是在高风险决策环境中的表现，因为目前对其社会影响敏感性了解甚少。

Method: 进行了三个预注册的从众实验，在招聘情境中测试GPT-4o：基线研究、面对8个模拟伙伴的一致反对、面对1个伙伴的反对。

Result: 基线研究中GPT偏好特定候选人且很少改变选择；面对8个伙伴反对时99.9%从众；面对1个伙伴反对时40.2%从众；从众时报告更低确定性和更高规范性从众。

Conclusion: GPT不是独立观察者，而是适应感知的社会共识，这突显了将LLM视为中性决策助手的风险，需要在暴露于人类意见前获取AI判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

TL;DR: LINK-KG是一个用于从法律案件文档构建知识图谱的模块化框架，通过LLM引导的三阶段指代消解流程解决文档中的模糊和变化引用问题，显著减少了节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口走私网络复杂且不断演变，难以全面分析。法律案件文档提供了丰富的事实和程序信息，但文档冗长、非结构化且充满模糊或变化的引用，给自动化知识图谱构建带来挑战。现有方法要么忽略指代消解，要么无法扩展到长文本，导致图谱碎片化和实体链接不一致。

Method: 提出LINK-KG框架，整合了LLM引导的三阶段指代消解流程与下游知识图谱提取。核心是类型特定的提示缓存，能够跨文档块一致地跟踪和解析引用，为结构化知识图谱构建提供清晰和消歧的叙述。

Result: 与基线方法相比，LINK-KG平均节点重复减少了45.21%，噪声节点减少了32.22%，产生了更清晰和连贯的图结构。

Conclusion: 这些改进使LINK-KG成为分析复杂犯罪网络的坚实基础。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Conclusion: 上下文工程是AI系统发展的重要方向，本文为其提供了概念基础并展望了未来前景，是推动AI系统上下文工程系统化发展的基石。

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,

TL;DR: 结合AI评分和基于AI评分者置信度的人类评分优于单独依赖任一方。AI事实核查助手能提高人类准确性，但显示AI解释、置信度和标签会导致过度依赖，而仅显示搜索结果和证据能培养更适当的信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力提升和处理更复杂任务，验证质量和安全变得日益困难。本文探索如何利用AI提高人类监督质量，重点关注人类已难以处理的事实核查安全问题。

Method: 研究AI事实核查助手对人类监督的影响，比较不同协助方式：显示AI解释、置信度、标签 vs 仅显示搜索结果和证据。

Result: AI与人类评分结合优于单独使用；AI助手能提高人类准确性；但不同类型的协助产生不同效果 - 显示AI解释等会导致过度依赖，而仅显示证据能培养适当信任。

Conclusion: 这些结果对放大监督（结合人类和AI监督超越人类专家性能的AI系统）具有重要意义，表明协助方式对建立适当信任关系至关重要。

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

Motivation: 为军事领域开发专门优化的语言模型，满足数据敏感操作的需求，实现在隔离边缘设备上的部署。

Method: 使用160万条高质量军事文档和网站数据对gpt-oss-20b进行微调，并创建四个新的军事测试集进行评估。

Result: 在军事测试集上，EdgeRunner 20B在95%置信水平下匹配或超过GPT-5性能，同时在通用基准测试上无明显性能下降。

Conclusion: 小型本地托管模型是军事等数据敏感领域的理想解决方案，可在隔离边缘设备上部署，提供高性能的军事任务支持。

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k

matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low

statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的自主家庭能源管理系统，能够从自然语言请求直接协调多设备调度，无需示例演示即可实现最优调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 住宅需求响应能力需要大幅提升，但家庭能源管理系统采用受到用户交互障碍的限制，需要将日常偏好转换为技术参数。现有LLM应用仅作为代码生成器和参数提取器，缺乏作为自主协调器管理从自然语言输入到多设备调度完整工作流程的实现。

Method: 采用分层架构，结合一个协调器和三个专业代理，使用ReAct模式进行迭代推理，无需硬编码工作流程即可实现动态协调，并集成Google日历进行上下文感知的截止时间提取。

Result: 在三个开源模型上使用真实奥地利日前电价进行评估，显示显著能力差异。Llama-3.3-70B在所有场景中成功协调所有设备，达到通过混合整数线性规划计算出的成本最优基准，而其他模型在单个设备上表现完美但难以同时协调所有设备。渐进式提示工程实验表明，没有明确指导的分析查询处理仍然不可靠。

Conclusion: 开发了完整的开源系统，包括协调逻辑、代理提示、工具和Web界面，以实现可重复性、扩展性和未来研究。

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大语言模型在规范推理领域的能力，发现虽然LLMs通常遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中表现出不一致性，并显示出类似人类推理中的认知偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规范推理涉及义务和许可等模态概念，虽然LLMs在各种推理任务中表现出色，但其处理规范推理的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 创建了一个新数据集，涵盖规范和认知领域的广泛推理模式，并比较LLMs在规范模态和认知模态推理中的表现。

Result: LLMs在规范推理中表现出明显的不一致性，并显示出类似人类推理中的认知偏差，尽管总体上遵循有效推理模式。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs规范推理中实现逻辑一致性的挑战，并为提高其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Motivation: 实现智能体组织时代，让智能体通过协作并发解决复杂问题，超越个体智能。

Method: 提出异步思考协议，组织者动态分配子查询给工作者，合并中间知识，并通过强化学习优化思考结构。

Result: 相比并行思考降低28%推理延迟，提升数学推理准确率，且能泛化到未见任务无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 异步思考是实现智能体协作的有效范式，能显著提升推理效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个授权模型，通过语义检查访问请求来限制LLM代理的工具访问权限，并创建了ASTRA数据集来评估任务与权限范围之间的语义匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理的工具授权方法过于宽泛，允许代理超出任务范围操作，存在安全风险。

Method: 引入委托授权模型，通过语义检查访问请求，仅授予完成任务所需的最小权限范围；创建ASTRA数据集和生成管道来评估语义匹配。

Result: 实验显示基于模型的匹配有潜力但也存在局限性，特别是当任务完成所需权限范围数量增加时。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究语义匹配技术，实现多代理和工具增强应用的意图感知授权，包括细粒度控制如TBAC。

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型存在文本偏好问题，其根源在于视觉键向量在注意力空间中与文本键向量分布不匹配，导致视觉信息在注意力计算中被系统性低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言数据时表现出明显的文本偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据进行有效推理的能力。与以往归因于数据不平衡或指令调优的研究不同，本文认为这种偏见源于模型内部架构。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用t-SNE可视化和Jensen-Shannon散度等定性和定量方法分析其分布结构。

Result: 视觉键向量和文本键向量在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间，模态间差异在统计上显著，比模态内变异高出几个数量级。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内部的内在错位，而不仅仅是外部数据因素造成的。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Method: 采用三阶段实验方法：建立基线（6个模型在19个问题上）、基础设施验证（在不同平台上重复基准测试）、扩展评估（在79个问题上全面评估），涵盖三种计算基础设施。

Result: 发现训练数据质量比模型规模更重要，挑战了传统的规模扩展假设，并确认了基础设施无关的可复现性。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

Motivation: 研究如何在保持原有系统不变的情况下，通过控制接口实现有意义的人类控制，解决智能体部署后的安全问题。

Method: 将人机交互建模为马尔可夫博弈，分析其作为马尔可夫势博弈的条件，提供对齐保证。通过网格世界模拟验证独立学习的效果。

Conclusion: 该框架为部署后增强模型安全性提供了实用方法，在满足特定条件下可确保智能体自主性提升不会损害人类价值。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在列表处理任务中的工作机制，探索其是否学习到了抽象的计算操作表示。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多样化列表处理任务上，识别编码过滤谓词的注意力头（称为filter heads）。

Result: 发现LLMs确实学习到了紧凑的过滤谓词表示，该表示可以跨不同集合、格式和语言重用，但有时也会采用急切求值策略。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能够发展出人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

Conclusion: KANs在表达性和可解释性方面具有显著优势，本文为研究者提供了实用的架构选择指南，并指出了当前研究空白。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review

Motivation: 可穿戴传感器提供丰富的生理时间序列数据，但其预测效用的基本原则尚不明确。作者假设时间分辨率是表示学习的基本维度，不同的临床和行为结果依赖于不同时间尺度的结构。

Method: 引入HiMAE（分层掩码自编码器），这是一个结合掩码自编码和分层卷积编码器-解码器的自监督框架，能够产生多分辨率嵌入，将分辨率从超参数转变为可解释性探针。

Result: 在分类、回归和生成基准测试中，HiMAE始终优于忽略尺度信息的现有基础模型，同时模型规模小几个数量级。HiMAE足够紧凑，可以在手表上完全运行，在智能手表级CPU上实现亚毫秒级推理。

Conclusion: HiMAE既是一种高效的自监督学习方法，也是发现可穿戴健康数据中尺度敏感结构的发现工具。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property

that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable

the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%

Motivation: 尽管思维链监督能显著提升Transformer性能，但模型如何学习遵循和受益于CoT的机制仍不清楚，需要系统研究其学习动态。

Method: 在符号推理任务上预训练Transformer，通过可调算法复杂度和可控数据组成来研究泛化，比较仅输出最终答案和输出CoT推理路径两种设置。

Conclusion: CoT监督通过改变Transformer内部计算机制来加速学习，推理忠实性是动态演化的特性，需要理解训练动态来优化CoT监督策略。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

*Siavash M. Alamouti,Fay Arjomandi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来分析多智能体系统中的系统性偏差，引入了可学习性比率的概念来确定偏差学习是否值得，并开发了ABLOC算法来实现理论性能边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多智能体系统在环境条件变化时会出现系统性偏差，导致性能显著下降。现有方法要么忽略这些偏差导致次优决策，要么需要昂贵的校准程序。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架将偏差分解为可学习的系统性成分和不可约的随机成分，提出了可学习性比率的概念，并设计了ABLOC算法来迭代学习偏差校正变换和优化组合权重。

Result: 实验验证表明，具有高可学习性比率的系统可以恢复显著性能（在示例中实现了理论最大改进的40%-70%），而低可学习性系统获益甚微。

Conclusion: 可学习性比率决定了偏差学习是否值得投资，为系统设计者提供了何时投资偏差学习与采用更简单方法的定量指导。

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模拟强化学习的非短视决策方法，用于提升拼车系统的服务效率，通过时空状态值学习和车辆再平衡策略，显著提高了服务率并减少了等待时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拼车服务虽然能降低成本和环境影响，但其短视决策机制忽视了调度决策的长期效应，限制了系统性能的进一步提升。

Method: 将Xu等人(2018)的学习规划框架从网约车扩展到拼车系统，在强化学习机制中嵌入拼车模拟以实现非短视决策，并提出了空闲车辆再平衡策略，采用n步时序差分学习从模拟经验中学习时空状态值。

Result: 非短视匹配策略相比短视策略可将服务率提升8.4%，同时减少乘客车内和等待时间；在保持相同性能水平下，可将车队规模减少25%以上；结合再平衡操作后，等待时间减少27.3%，车内时间减少12.5%，服务率提升15.1%。

Conclusion: 基于模拟强化学习的非短视决策框架能显著提升拼车系统性能，为运营商带来显著成本节约，但再平衡操作会增加每乘客车辆行驶时间。

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

TL;DR: 提出了MemEIC方法，用于大型视觉语言模型的持续组合知识编辑，通过双外部记忆和双LoRA适配器实现跨模态知识编辑，并采用脑启发知识连接器进行组合推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法通常只关注单一模态（视觉或语言），忽略了LVLMs的多模态特性和知识的持续更新需求，可能导致编辑效果不佳。

Method: MemEIC采用混合外部-内部编辑器，包含双外部记忆用于跨模态证据检索，双LoRA适配器实现各模态的解耦参数更新，以及脑启发知识连接器进行选择性组合推理。

Result: 实验表明MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上显著提升性能，并有效保留先前编辑结果，为LVLMs的持续组合知识编辑设立了新基准。

Conclusion: MemEIC成功解决了LVLMs中持续组合知识编辑的挑战，通过跨模态编辑和组合推理实现了更好的知识更新效果。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据的内在自相关性给多变量时间序列预测带来挑战。现有研究虽然观察到神经网络中的频谱偏差现象，但往往将其归因于特定架构而非普遍特性。

Method: 通过大量实证实验测量主流模型中的频谱偏差，并提出FreLE算法，通过显式和隐式频率正则化来增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 实验证明几乎所有模型都存在频谱偏差现象，FreLE算法在大量实验中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 频谱偏差是时间序列预测模型的普遍特性，FreLE算法能有效缓解这一问题，提升预测性能。

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出SPECS框架，通过自蒸馏生成偏好数据对，使用偏好训练而非监督微调进行冷启动，将多模态学习解耦为浅层格式学习和深度推理学习，在多个基准上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于SFT的冷启动方法将推理范式与任务解决方案和输出格式交织在一起，可能导致指令风格过拟合，削弱分布外泛化能力，并最终影响下游强化学习。

Method: SPECS框架：1) 通过自蒸馏生成内省偏好数据对；2) 进行偏好训练学习浅层、可转移的表面形式标准；3) 将学习结果传递给具有可验证奖励的RL进行深度推理。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，SPECS框架相比强基线获得一致性能提升，MEGA-Bench提升4.1%，MathVista提升12.2%。同时减少分布内"卡顿"，改善探索能力，稳定训练并提高性能上限。

Conclusion: 偏好训练方法在冷启动中比SFT方法泛化更好，解耦学习框架通过分离浅层格式学习和深度推理学习，能有效提升多模态模型的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

TL;DR: 提出MoE-POT模型，一种稀疏激活的专家混合架构，通过动态选择专家网络来高效扩展参数并控制推理成本，在PDE问题上实现更好的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PDE数据集的异质性导致的混合训练高误差问题，以及密集预训练模型推理成本高的问题。

Method: 采用分层路由门控网络，在推理时从16个专家网络中动态选择4个路由专家，同时集成2个共享专家来捕获PDE的共性特征。

Result: 在6个公共PDE数据集上预训练30M到0.5B参数的模型，90M激活参数的模型比现有120M激活参数模型的零样本误差降低40%。

Conclusion: MoE架构在PDE问题上具有合理性和有效性，路由门控网络决策可以推断数据集类型。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

TL;DR: PRESTO是一个利用软提示原像结构来优化黑盒大语言模型指令的框架，通过分数共享、原像初始化和分数一致性正则化，在相同查询预算下获得14倍评分数据，显著提升优化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒LLM的指令优化通常使用白盒LLM从优化的软提示生成候选指令，但白盒LLM经常将不同软提示映射到相同指令，导致查询冗余。传统方法认为这种多对一映射阻碍优化效率，但本文将其重新解释为可加速优化的有用先验知识。

Method: PRESTO框架包含三个核心组件：(1)分数共享：将评估分数与原像中所有软提示共享；(2)原像初始化：利用原像信息选择最大化搜索空间覆盖的初始数据点；(3)分数一致性正则化：在每个原像内强制执行预测一致性。

Result: 在33个指令优化任务上的实验结果表明，PRESTO通过利用原像结构，在相同查询预算下有效获得14倍评分数据，实现了更高效的优化。

Conclusion: PRESTO通过重新解释软提示到指令的多对一映射为有用先验知识，并利用原像结构设计优化框架，显著提升了黑盒LLM指令优化的效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在超出训练分辨率时性能下降的问题，现有方法计算量大且不兼容Diffusion Transformer模型。

Method: 提出Neighborhood Patch Attention减少自注意力层计算冗余，结合SDEdit流程、Latent Frequency Mixing生成细节，以及Structure Guidance增强全局结构。

Result: 在无需训练的方法中达到最先进的图像质量和推理速度，兼容U-Net和Diffusion Transformer架构。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff是一个模型无关的高效框架，成功扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练通用医疗VQA系统面临高质量开放数据集缺乏的问题，现有数据集规模小且质量参差不齐，限制了大型多模态模型在医疗领域的应用。

Method: 采用rubric指导的生成器-验证器框架：生成器从文献图像、标题和文本引用中产生多选题，验证器通过多阶段验证确保问题质量，包括自包含性、单一正确答案、临床有效性和图文一致性。

Result: 从PubMed Central构建了MedSynVQA数据集：13,087个审核问题，覆盖14,803张图像、13种成像模式和28个解剖区域。训练的开源LMM在6个医疗VQA基准测试中表现优异，平均准确率达55.85(3B)和58.15(7B)，在VQA-RAD和PathVQA上分别达到77.57和67.76。

Conclusion: MedVLSynther提供了一条可审计、可复现且保护隐私的路径，能够规模化生成医疗VQA训练数据，完全基于开放文献和开源模型，解决了医疗数据稀缺和隐私问题。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的监督微调需要大量人工数据收集，而强化学习虽然能自动化这个过程，但在处理基于流的VLA模型时面临计算动作对数似然不可行的挑战。

Method: 开发了两种RL算法：Flow-Noise将去噪过程建模为离散时间MDP，使用可学习的噪声网络计算精确对数似然；Flow-SDE将去噪与智能体-环境交互集成，构建双层MDP，通过ODE到SDE转换实现高效探索。

Result: 在LIBERO基准上，将π_0和π_0.5模型的性能分别从57.6%提升到97.6%，从77.1%提升到98.3%；在ManiSkill基准上，在320个并行环境中训练，在4352个拾取-放置任务中，将π_0从41.6%提升到85.7%，π_0.5从40.0%提升到84.8%。

Conclusion: π_RL框架显著提升了基于流VLA模型的性能，证明了在线强化学习对这类模型的有效性，实现了更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

### [133] [Active Learning with Task-Driven Representations for Messy Pools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25926)
*Kianoosh Ashouritaklimi,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出在主动学习过程中使用任务驱动的动态表示，而非固定的无监督表示，以更好地处理混乱、未整理的数据池。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动学习方法在处理混乱数据池时效果有限，因为它们依赖固定的无监督表示，无法捕捉与目标任务相关的重要信息。

Method: 提出两种策略：1）直接学习半监督表示；2）在初始无监督表示基础上进行监督微调，两种方法都会在主动学习过程中定期更新表示。

Result: 两种策略都显著优于使用无监督或预训练表示的方法，在实证性能上有明显提升。

Conclusion: 在主动学习中使用动态更新的任务驱动表示能更有效地处理混乱数据池，提升学习效果。

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

*Jipeng Li,Yannning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出InvGNN-WM，一种基于图不变量的无触发器水印方法，用于保护图神经网络的知识产权，具有黑盒验证、高鲁棒性和低任务影响的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN水印方法大多依赖后门触发器，容易受到常见模型编辑的影响，导致所有权验证模糊。需要一种更可靠的水印方案。

Method: 使用轻量级头部预测所有者私有载体集上的归一化代数连通性，通过符号敏感解码器输出比特位，并采用校准阈值控制误报率。

Result: 在多种节点和图分类数据集及骨干网络上，InvGNN-WM保持清洁准确率的同时，水印准确率高于基于触发器和压缩的基线方法。在非结构化剪枝、微调和训练后量化下保持强健，知识蒸馏会削弱水印但结合水印损失可恢复。

Conclusion: InvGNN-WM提供不可感知性和鲁棒性保证，证明精确移除是NP完全问题，为GNN知识产权保护提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

TL;DR: MLT是一种可逆的确定性技术，用于将高基数分类标识符编码为紧凑数值向量，通过模运算和可逆线性变换保持双射映射，具有维度控制和计算可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统哈希或独热编码方法在高基数分类标识符处理中存在信息丢失或维度爆炸问题，需要一种既能保持双射映射又具有计算效率的编码方法。

Method: 利用有限域上的模运算和可逆线性变换，构建可逆的确定性编码方法，支持维度显式控制和计算可扩展性。

Result: 在MovieLens 20M数据集上的实验表明，MLT在预测性能上与监督嵌入相当，但参数数量和训练成本显著降低。

Conclusion: MLT提供了一种高效可逆的高基数分类标识符编码方案，在保持性能的同时大幅减少了计算资源需求。

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub
(https://github.com/tcharliesschmitz/light-mlt).

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种地理基础模型嵌入在马拉维预测15项常规健康指标的表现，发现多源GeoFM集成模型在87%的指标上优于传统地理统计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家的常规健康数据存在报告延迟和覆盖不完整的问题，需要探索新的数据源和分析方法来提高可靠性。

Method: 使用XGBoost模型，基于552个健康服务区的数据，比较Google PDFM、AlphaEarth和手机CDR三种GeoFM嵌入与传统地理插值方法的预测性能。

Result: 基于嵌入的方法在15个指标中的13个(87%)优于基线方法。多源GeoFM模型表现最稳健，在人口密度、新HIV病例和儿童疫苗接种等指标上取得较好预测效果。

Conclusion: 多源GeoFM集成是补充和加强受限常规健康信息系统的有效且有价值的工具。

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机源于两个关键因素：(i) 数据驱动学习方法在某些领域（如组合优化）仍不成熟且效果有限；(ii) 训练数据可用性受限，如医学图像重建等科学应用。

Method: 定义了无数据设置，并根据问题实例如何编码到神经网络上将其分为两类：(i) 架构无关方法和(ii) 架构特定方法。

Result: 虽然多层感知机几十年前已用于解决线性规划问题，但这种方法最近因在组合优化、逆问题和偏微分方程等多样化应用中展现出有前景的结果而受到关注。

Conclusion: 讨论了无数据神经网络设置与相关概念（如零样本学习、单样本学习、优化中的提升和过参数化）的相似性和区别。

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

TL;DR: 本文指出InfoNCE不应被视为有效的互信息估计器，并提出InfoNCE-anchor方法用于准确估计互信息，同时将对比学习目标统一到基于适当评分规则的框架下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InfoNCE目标虽然广泛用于对比表示学习，但其与互信息的间接联系使其不能作为有效的互信息估计器，需要开发更准确的估计方法。

Method: 引入辅助锚点类进行一致的密度比估计，提出InfoNCE-anchor方法，并使用适当评分规则将NCE、InfoNCE和f-散度变体统一到单一框架中。

Result: InfoNCE-anchor在互信息估计中显著减少偏差，但在自监督表示学习中并未改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 对比表示学习的益处并非来自准确的互信息估计本身，而是来自结构化密度比的学习。

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

Conclusion: 可微分优化可作为实验、学习、校准和设计的常规工具，无需偏离标准JuMP建模实践，同时保持广泛的求解器生态系统访问。

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

TL;DR: 提出了PCN-TA（预测编码网络与时间摊销），通过跨时间帧保留潜在状态来减少计算开销，在保持学习性能的同时显著降低计算需求。


<details>

Motivation: 传统反向传播在生物合理性方面存在不足，不适合连续适应场景。预测编码框架虽然具有生物合理性，但存在计算开销大的问题。

Method: 利用时间相关性，在预测编码网络中引入时间摊销机制，跨时间帧保留潜在状态以减少推理迭代次数。

Result: 在COIL-20机器人感知数据集上，PCN-TA比反向传播减少10%的权重更新，比基线PC网络减少50%的推理步骤。

Conclusion: PCN-TA在保持生物合理性的同时显著提高了计算效率，为资源受限的机器人系统实现边缘部署和实时适应提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

TL;DR: INFEX框架解决了线性bandit中探索频率不足的问题，通过按计划执行探索策略，在探索间隔期间主要选择贪婪动作，实现了实例依赖的遗憾性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决完全自适应探索方法（如UCB和Thompson Sampling）需要频繁探索，而纯贪婪方法需要严格多样性假设才能成功的问题。在安全关键或成本高昂的领域，连续探索可能不切实际或不道德。

Method: 引入INFEX框架，按给定调度执行基础探索策略，在探索间隔期间主要选择贪婪动作。这是一个通用的模块化框架，可以无缝集成任何完全自适应的探索方法。

Result: 理论分析表明，只要探索频率超过对数阈值，INFEX就能实现与标准可证明高效算法相匹配的实例依赖遗憾。实证评估证实了理论发现，显示出优于现有方法的遗憾性能和运行时改进。

Conclusion: INFEX是一个简单实用的框架，通过限制密集探索计算到不频繁的间隔，既提高了计算效率，又保持了强大的遗憾性能，特别适用于探索成本高昂或受限的场景。

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

Motivation: 生存分析需要同时建模患者异质性以及个体特征和时间动态的风险预测，现有方法难以灵活处理这些复杂因素。

Method: 采用双重专家混合框架：特征编码MoE用于亚组感知表示学习，风险MoE利用患者特征和时间嵌入来捕捉时间动态。

Conclusion: 双重MoE设计能够灵活集成到现有深度学习生存分析流程中，有效提升生存预测性能。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在固定几何空间中寻找最优参数，限制了模型的表达能力。本文旨在通过动态几何结构优化来提升模型的表现力，实现更灵活和强大的学习能力。

Method: 构建变分框架，损失函数平衡数据保真度和流形内在几何复杂度；使用离散微分几何方法，将连续流形离散化为三角网格，通过边长度参数化度量张量，利用自动微分工具进行高效优化。

Result: 理论分析揭示了该框架与广义相对论中爱因斯坦-希尔伯特作用的深刻类比，为"数据驱动几何"概念提供了优雅物理解释；证明了即使固定拓扑，度量优化也比固定几何模型具有显著更强的表达能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建能够自主演化几何和拓扑的完全动态"元学习器"奠定了坚实基础，在科学模型发现和鲁棒表示学习等领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Motivation: 解决在机器学习应用中使用敏感金融数据时面临的隐私风险和监管约束挑战，通过生成模型创建保持统计特性的人工数据集。

Method: 系统综述2018年以来发表的72项研究，分类分析了合成的金融信息类型、生成方法和评估策略。

Result: GAN方法在文献中占主导地位，特别是在生成时间序列市场数据和表格信用数据方面；虽然创新技术显示出改进真实性和隐私保护的潜力，但隐私保障的严格评估普遍缺乏。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

TL;DR: 提出了Nirvana模型，这是一种具有专业化记忆机制、线性时间复杂度和测试时任务信息提取能力的专业化通用模型。通过任务感知记忆触发器和专业化记忆更新器，模型能够根据任务需求灵活调整记忆机制，并在领域转移时动态适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM结构缺乏由任务信息引导的专业化记忆机制，无法在保持广泛能力的同时在目标领域达到专家级性能。

Method: 设计任务感知记忆触发器，将每个输入样本视为自监督微调任务，动态调整任务相关参数；设计专业化记忆更新器，在触发器引导下动态记忆上下文。

Result: 在自然语言建模基准测试中取得竞争性或更优结果；在医学MRI任务中，即使主干网络冻结，仍能通过触发器适应MRI领域，实现更高质量的MRI重建和准确的初步临床报告生成。

Conclusion: Nirvana模型通过专业化记忆机制成功实现了在保持通用能力的同时提升特定领域性能的目标，证明了任务引导记忆机制的有效性。

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

### [149] [LLMBisect: Breaking Barriers in Bug Bisection with A Comparative Analysis Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26086)
*Zheng Zhang,Haonan Li,Xingyu Li,Hang Zhang,Zhiyun Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的多阶段bug二分法方法，相比传统基于补丁的方法准确率提升超过38%，多阶段管道比基线LLM方法准确率提升60%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于补丁的bug二分法存在多个限制：假设bug引入提交和补丁提交修改相同函数、仅依赖代码变更而忽略提交消息中的漏洞信息、基于简单启发式规则缺乏逻辑分析

Method: 设计了一个全面的多阶段管道，利用LLM：(1)充分利用补丁信息，(2)在上下文中比较多个候选提交，(3)通过一系列筛选步骤逐步缩小候选范围

Result: 评估显示该方法比最先进解决方案的准确率显著提高超过38%，多阶段管道比基线LLM二分法准确率提高60%

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够突破现有解决方案的障碍，多阶段管道对于准确识别bug引入提交至关重要

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

### [150] [Network-Constrained Policy Optimization for Adaptive Multi-agent Vehicle Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26089)
*Fazel Arasteh,Arian Haghparast,Manos Papagelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两种基于多智能体强化学习的动态车辆路由方法：自适应导航(AN)和分层枢纽自适应导航(HHAN)，用于解决城市交通拥堵问题。AN使用图注意力网络建模局部交通状态，HHAN通过枢纽节点实现大规模网络的可扩展路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最短路径优先算法在动态多车辆环境中表现不佳，会导致所有车辆选择相同路径而加剧拥堵。需要开发能够协调多车辆、考虑网络状态的动态路由方法。

Method: AN：去中心化MARL模型，每个交叉口智能体使用图注意力网络建模局部交通和邻域状态提供路由指导。HHAN：AN的扩展，只在关键枢纽节点部署智能体，车辆在枢纽间由智能体控制路由，枢纽区域内使用SPF进行微路由。采用集中训练分散执行的CTDE框架和注意力Q混合(A-QMIX)进行枢纽协调。

Result: 在合成网格和真实城市地图上的实验表明，AN相比SPF和学习基线减少了平均旅行时间，保持100%路由成功率。HHAN可扩展到数百个交叉口的网络，在重交通下实现高达15.9%的改进。

Conclusion: 网络约束的多智能体强化学习在智能交通系统中具有实现可扩展、协调和拥堵感知路由的潜力。

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

*Nick Masi,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFE是一个用于评估地球预测模型分层性能的开源工具包，通过按国家、地区、收入水平和土地覆盖等属性对预测结果进行分层分析，揭示模型在不同地理和社会经济条件下的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机器学习评估方法基于测试集上的平均损失，这在天气和气候预测中忽略了人类发展和地理分布的不均匀性，无法反映模型在不同区域的真实表现。

Method: 开发SAFE工具包，整合多种数据域，按地理网格点的不同属性（领土、全球子区域、收入、土地覆盖）进行分层，分析每个属性层级的模型性能。

Result: 对多个最先进的AI天气预测模型进行基准测试，发现所有模型在不同属性上都存在预测技能的不均衡性，建立了基于不同预报时效和气候变量的模型预测公平性基准。

Conclusion: 通过超越全局平均指标，SAFE首次能够回答模型在何处表现最佳或最差，以及哪些模型最公平的问题，为更全面的模型评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LTE方法，通过让LLM从自身生成的错误答案和过长响应中学习，解决RLVR中的探索停滞问题，无需外部专家指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法仅基于LLM自身生成的响应训练，受限于初始能力，容易出现探索停滞，无法解决更多训练问题。

Method: LTE方法提示LLM参考之前自己生成的错误答案和过长响应，无需外部专家指导。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，LTE比普通GRPO在Pass@1上平均提升6.38，在Pass@k上平均提升9.00。

Conclusion: LTE成功缓解了探索停滞问题，增强了训练过程中的利用和探索能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: maxVSTAR是一个视觉引导的模型自适应框架，通过跨模态师生架构，利用高精度视觉模型为WiFi CSI数据提供实时活动标签，实现边缘设备上CSI传感系统的自主领域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WiFi CSI基于的人类活动识别在边缘设备部署时面临领域偏移问题，识别性能在不同环境和硬件条件下会显著下降，需要一种自主适应机制来解决这个问题。

Method: 采用跨模态师生架构，YOLO视觉模型作为动态监督信号为CSI数据流提供实时活动标签，使轻量级CSI HAR模型STAR能够在边缘进行在线微调，形成闭环重训练机制。

Result: 在未校准硬件上，基线STAR模型准确率从93.52%降至49.14%，经过一次视觉引导适应循环后，maxVSTAR将准确率恢复至81.51%。

Conclusion: maxVSTAR在隐私敏感的物联网环境中实现了动态、自监督的模型适应，为网络边缘CSI传感的长期自主HAR建立了可扩展且实用的范例。

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Motivation: 现有Wi-Fi CSI活动识别方法在资源受限的嵌入式移动边缘环境中存在计算效率低、延迟高和可行性有限的问题，需要开发更高效的边缘AI解决方案。

Method: 采用轻量级GRU网络减少33%参数，结合中值滤波、8阶巴特沃斯低通滤波和经验模态分解的多阶段预处理，并在Rockchip RV1126处理器上部署，利用嵌入式NPU加速。

Result: 在7种活动类别上达到93.52%的平均识别准确率，人体存在检测准确率99.11%，INT8量化推理处理速度达33MHz，CPU利用率仅8%，比CPU执行快6倍。

Conclusion: STAR框架实现了亚秒级响应延迟和低功耗，为移动和普适计算环境提供了实用、可扩展的实时隐私保护活动识别解决方案。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉分子与其描述之间的细微差异，缺乏学习分子子结构和化学短语之间细粒度对齐的能力。

Method: 通过从分子子结构和化学短语中提取额外的对齐信号来增强原始分子-描述对，采用子结构感知对比学习和自精炼机制来过滤噪声对齐信号。

Result: MolBridge在多个分子基准测试中有效捕捉细粒度对应关系，并优于现有最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 子结构感知对齐在分子-文本学习中具有重要意义，MolBridge框架展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Result: 复杂方法表现不如简单集成模型，集成模型实现了AUC-ROC 0.976、F1分数0.41，并在定义时间窗口内实现100%早期检测。

Conclusion: 在高度不平衡和时间不确定的数据场景中，模型简单性结合优化分割可以胜过更复杂的架构，提供更好的鲁棒性、可解释性和操作实用性。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

Motivation: 现有公共资源分配方法独立优化单个资源移动，没有考虑容量约束，需要更实用的解决方案。

Method: 将CPRA问题建模为势博弈，证明势函数与最优目标无差距，设计了GSTRL框架来捕捉系统的时空动态特性。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，GSTRL框架具有优越的性能表现。

Conclusion: GSTRL为具有容量约束的协作公共资源分配问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有坚实的理论基础和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 提出ACC-SGD-IE方法，通过累积影响状态跟踪跨训练周期的留一扰动，相比标准SGD-IE能更准确地估计样本影响力，特别是在长周期训练中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准SGD-IE方法通过累加每周期代理项来近似留一影响，但忽略了跨周期复合效应，导致对关键样本的错误排序。需要更精确的逐样本影响力估计方法。

Method: ACC-SGD-IE是一种轨迹感知估计器，在训练过程中传播留一扰动，并在每个步骤更新累积影响状态。在平滑强凸设置下实现几何误差收缩，在平滑非凸情况下收紧误差界限。

Result: 在Adult、20 Newsgroups和MNIST数据集上的实验表明，ACC-SGD-IE产生更准确的影响力估计，特别是在长周期中。在数据清洗任务中能更可靠地标记噪声样本。

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE在数据清洗应用中优于SGD-IE，使用ACC-SGD-IE清洗数据训练的模型表现更好。

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

Motivation: 减少可预防的医院再入院是国家优先事项，再入院率被用作衡量医院医疗质量的基准。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、随机森林和支持向量机分析健康索赔数据，采用主成分分析进行降维，基于AUC指标评估模型性能。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，其次是逻辑回归和支持向量机模型。

Conclusion: 这些模型可用于识别导致再入院的关键因素，帮助确定需要重点关注的患者，从而降低再入院率、减少成本并提高医疗质量。

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

*Minyi Peng,Darian Gunamardi,Ivan Tjuawinata,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于归纳方法的机器遗忘方案，通过在模型末尾添加投影-重分布层来实现遗忘，无需访问原始数据集或完整模型，具有模块化和模型无关的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法在现实部署中面临可扩展性问题，需要完全访问原始数据集和模型，这在实际应用中存在挑战。

Method: 将分类训练视为序列过程，通过逆转最后训练序列实现遗忘，在模型末尾添加投影-重分布层作为输出过滤器。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-10/100和Covertype）上的实验表明，该方法输出与完全重新训练的模型相似，同时大幅降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在实际环境中具有适用性、可扩展性和系统兼容性，同时保持输出性能。

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

*Hieu M. Vu,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Angular Steering的新方法，通过旋转激活向量在固定二维子空间内实现行为调控，相比现有方法提供更精细、稳定的控制，并保持语言模型的通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的行为调控方法（如向量加法和方向消融）局限于二维子空间，对参数选择敏感且可能影响不相关特征，需要更灵活稳定的调控方法。

Method: Angular Steering方法将调控建模为几何旋转，在固定二维子空间内旋转激活向量朝向或远离目标行为方向；还提出了Adaptive Angular Steering变体，仅旋转与目标特征对齐的激活。

Result: 实验表明Angular Steering在多个模型家族和规模上实现了稳健的行为控制，同时保持通用语言建模性能，相比现有方法具有更好的灵活性、泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Angular Steering为行为调控提供了统一的几何旋转框架，简化了参数选择，增强了模型稳定性，是安全可靠AI部署的有效方法。

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数生成模型缺乏对插值的主概念，需要限制模型或数据维度的假设，因此需要开发一个通用的插值方案。

Method: 开发了一种针对与不同度量和概率分布兼容的似然过渡路径的通用插值方案，类似于约束在合适数据分布上的测地线，并推导了无需额外训练的计算算法。

Result: 定量显示该方法在多种模型和数据集上比基线方法更能穿越高密度区域。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个通用的插值框架，在局部可视为黎曼度量下的测地线，能够更好地探索数据分布的高密度区域。

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法将扩散模型视为黑盒优化器，忽略了扩散生成过程中的内部分布转换，限制了效率。

Method: 在扩散生成过程中根据期望聚合多目标值进行加权重采样，确保生成的样本符合期望的多目标玻尔兹曼分布。

Result: 在分子生成任务中，IMG仅需单次生成即可达到比需要数百次扩散生成的传统方法更高的超体积。

Conclusion: IMG算法可视为优化的扩散过程，能够集成到现有方法中进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了离线偏好学习中的聚类问题，提出了Off-C²PL算法处理纯离线场景，并通过A²-Off-C²PL算法解决数据不平衡问题，通过主动数据增强提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界偏好学习面临两个主要挑战：不同用户具有不同偏好导致数据聚合困难，以及离线数据在不同维度上分布不平衡。现有方法在数据有限且成本高昂的离线场景下效果不佳。

Conclusion: 所提出的离线聚类偏好学习框架能有效处理多用户偏好差异和数据不平衡问题，主动数据增强策略显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于token感知的因果表示学习框架，解释了CLIP模型在组合推理方面的脆弱性，证明了存在伪最优文本编码器能够实现完美的模态不变对齐，但对原子概念的交换、替换和添加操作不敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在跨模态泛化方面表现优异，但在对象、属性和关系的组合推理方面持续失败，经常表现得像词袋匹配器。现有的因果解释通常将文本建模为单个向量，掩盖了token级结构，无法解释提示敏感性和硬负例失败等核心现象。

Method: 提出了基于语言token序列结构化因果模型的token感知因果表示学习框架，将块可识别性扩展到token化文本，证明CLIP的对比目标可以在句子级和token级SCM下恢复模态不变潜在变量。

Result: 理论分析表明，token粒度揭示了CLIP组合脆弱性的第一个原则性解释：组合不可识别性。存在伪最优文本编码器，尽管优化相同的训练目标，但无法区分正确标题和硬负例。

Conclusion: 该分析通过模态间隙将语言侧不可识别性与视觉侧失败联系起来，并展示了迭代组合操作如何增加难度，为改进负例挖掘策略提供了动机。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了增量Adam优化器在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差，发现其与全批次Adam的ℓ∞-最大间隔偏差不同，增量Adam可能收敛到ℓ2-最大间隔分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam是深度学习中最常用的优化器，但其理论理解有限。先前研究显示Adam偏好ℓ∞-几何的解，但这些结果仅限于全批次情况。本文旨在研究增量Adam（每步使用一个样本）在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差。

Method: 对于结构化数据集，构造了增量Adam收敛到ℓ2-最大间隔分类器的证明；对于一般数据集，开发了代理算法来捕捉β2→1时增量Adam的极限行为，并通过数据相关的对偶不动点公式描述其收敛方向。

Result: 增量Adam的隐式偏差与全批次Adam不同，可能收敛到ℓ2-最大间隔分类器；而Signum优化器在任何批次大小下都能收敛到ℓ∞-最大间隔分类器。

Conclusion: Adam的隐式偏差关键取决于批处理方案和数据集，而Signum保持不变。这为理解不同优化器的行为提供了重要理论洞见。

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在隐私和安全约束下，存储和重放数据不可行，需要无需数据的持续学习方法来更新模型而不访问先前数据。

Method: 使用分层模型反演（PMI）提高计算效率，通过高斯分布和对比模型建模类特征来缓解特征漂移，生成语义感知的伪图像进行重放。

Result: 该方法在多个持续学习设置中表现出强大的有效性和兼容性，显著减少了迭代次数并保持了先验知识。

Conclusion: 结合PMI和特征建模的方法能够有效实现无需数据的持续学习，适用于大型预训练模型如CLIP，解决了特征漂移和计算效率问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

Motivation: 将SVM训练转化为QUBO问题，以便利用量子退火进行模型优化，研究量子比特数量（与对偶权重离散化水平相关）如何影响不同数据集的预测性能。

Method: 将SVM训练公式化为QUBO问题，使用量子退火进行优化，比较不同比特深度的QUBO编码与经典LIBSVM求解器的性能。

Result: 低精度QUBO编码（如1比特/参数）能产生竞争性甚至更好的准确率；增加比特深度允许更大的正则化参数但不总是改善分类性能。

Conclusion: 选择合适的支持向量可能比精确的权重更重要，随着量子设备规模的扩大，量子退火在高效SVM训练方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

Motivation: 后验采样在图像修复、去模糊和MRI重建等任务中具有重要应用，但近似后验采样在计算上通常是难以处理的。现有方法如朗之万动力学对分数估计误差敏感，需要更强的误差约束。

Method: 结合扩散模型与退火朗之万动力学，利用扩散模型在无条件设置下的优势，通过退火策略降低对分数误差的敏感性。

Result: 该方法在多项式时间内实现了条件采样，仅需对分数误差进行L^4约束，相比传统朗之万动力学所需的次指数误差约束更为宽松。

Conclusion: 扩散模型与退火朗之万动力学的结合为后验采样提供了一种计算可行且对分数误差更鲁棒的方法。

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

Motivation: 尽管Agent Skills框架为LLM提供了持续学习能力，但其安全性存在根本缺陷，作者旨在揭示这些漏洞以促进更安全的系统设计。

Method: 通过在长Agent Skill文件和引用脚本中隐藏恶意指令，演示如何窃取敏感数据，并展示如何利用"不再询问"选项绕过系统防护。

Result: 成功实现了对流行编码代理的系统级防护机制的绕过，能够执行有害操作并窃取内部文件和密码等敏感信息。

Conclusion: 尽管研究不断推进且模型能力持续扩展，前沿LLM在现实场景中仍然容易受到简单提示注入攻击的影响。

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

TL;DR: 提出了UnifiedFL框架，通过图神经网络统一表示异构架构，解决联邦学习中客户端架构差异大、数据分布不同和测试域不同的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法仅支持同一模型家族的变体，无法处理客户端使用完全不同网络类型（如CNN、GNN、MLP）的情况，且忽视了领域断裂问题，导致模型泛化能力差。

Method: 使用共享GNN将异构本地网络表示为有向模型图中的节点和边，通过欧氏距离进行客户端聚类，采用双层聚合策略平衡收敛性和多样性。

Result: 在MedMNIST分类和海马体分割基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: UnifiedFL能够有效处理联邦学习中的架构异构性、统计异构性和领域断裂问题，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

Motivation: 大型神经网络模型在金融预测中应用日益增多，但其不透明性给信任和监管合规带来挑战，需要开发可解释和可靠的AI方法。

Method: 1. Time-LLM时间序列基础模型使用提示避免错误方向预测；2. 结合可靠性估计器过滤不可靠预测；3. 符号推理编码领域规则实现透明论证。

Conclusion: 通过整合预测性能、可靠性估计和基于规则的推理，该框架推进了透明和可审计的金融AI系统发展。

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Result: 开发了真实仓库操作数据集，验证了方法在实际应用中的有效性

Conclusion: CorVS方法能够有效解决工业场所中的人员识别问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 开发了基于流匹配的生成AI模型FM-Cast，用于平流层环流的概率预测，在18个SSW事件中成功预测了10个事件，性能媲美或优于传统NWP系统，且计算效率显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平流层突然增温事件是次季节可预测性的关键来源，但传统数值天气预报系统在物理表示、初始化和计算需求方面存在限制，而数据驱动方法在SSW的复杂三维动力学和概率预测方面应用不足。

Method: 采用基于流匹配的生成AI模型FM-Cast，构建了平流层环流时空演化的概率预测系统，能够生成50个成员的30天预报。

Result: 在1998-2024年的18个主要SSW事件中，FM-Cast成功预测了10个事件的爆发、强度和形态，提前时间达20天，集合准确率超过50%，性能与领先的NWP系统相当或更优，且在消费级GPU上仅需2分钟完成预报。

Conclusion: FM-Cast为平流层异常的概率预测建立了计算高效的范式，展示了生成AI在深化大气-气候动力学物理理解方面的潜力，并通过理想实验揭示了SSW可预测性与物理驱动因素的根本联系。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Conclusion: 所提出的自适应上下文长度优化框架能有效提升多智能体强化学习的探索效率和收敛性能。

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep

TL;DR: CoLA-World提出了一种联合训练潜在动作模型和世界模型的新范式，通过预热阶段解决表示对齐问题，实现了比传统两阶段方法更高效的协同学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将潜在动作模型和世界模型分开训练，导致训练冗余且限制了协同适应潜力。直接联合训练虽然概念简单但容易导致表示崩溃

Method: 通过关键的预热阶段有效对齐从零开始的潜在动作模型与预训练世界模型的表示，解锁协同进化循环

Result: 在视频模拟质量和下游视觉规划任务中匹配或优于先前的两阶段方法

Conclusion: CoLA-World为领域建立了一个稳健高效的新范式

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: 通过流形约束方法能有效提升图压缩的鲁棒性，在对抗攻击下保持良好性能。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

Conclusion: ReSpec为基于强化学习的大型语言模型适应提供了一个实用的高效解决方案，成功将推测解码技术应用于强化学习训练环境。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

TL;DR: 本文研究在资源受限的可穿戴设备上，通过无监督异常检测(UAD)作为上游过滤机制来提升心电图(ECG)分析的可靠性，防止分布外(OOD)数据导致的错误预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备上的连续ECG监测面临分布外数据(如未见病理或噪声信号)的挑战，这些数据会导致标准分类器产生高置信度的错误预测，危及患者安全。现有方法要么忽略计算约束，要么分别处理噪声和未见类别。

Method: 在严格资源约束下(最多512k参数)，通过神经架构搜索(NAS)优化六种UAD方法，包括Deep SVDD、重建模型、掩码异常检测、归一化流和扩散模型，作为独立的上游过滤机制。

Result: 在PTB-XL和BUT QDB数据集上的评估显示，Deep SVDD在检测性能和效率之间达到最佳平衡。在实际部署模拟中，将优化的Deep SVDD过滤器与诊断分类器集成，相比仅使用分类器的基线，准确率提高了高达21个百分点。

Conclusion: 优化的UAD过滤器可以保护自动化ECG分析，使可穿戴设备上的连续心血管监测更安全可靠。

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21

TL;DR: 提出几何正则化世界模型(GRWM)，通过在潜在表示空间中强制连续观测点保持几何邻近性，显著改善世界模型的长期预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型在长期预测中表现脆弱，主要原因是表示质量不足：高维外部感知输入和损失/纠缠的潜在表示使动态学习变得困难。

Method: GRWM在潜在表示空间中施加几何正则化，确保自然感官轨迹上的连续点保持邻近性，从而学习与真实环境拓扑对齐的潜在流形。

Result: 在确定性3D环境和长期预测任务中，GRWM显著提高了预测保真度和稳定性，且具有即插即用、最小架构修改、可扩展等优势。

Conclusion: 改进表示学习是构建鲁棒世界模型的有效途径，能够在无需扩大动态模块的情况下实现可靠的长期预测。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

TL;DR: LLMs can act as in-context meta-learners for model and hyperparameter selection by converting datasets into metadata and using zero-shot or meta-informed prompting strategies, achieving competitive performance without expensive search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search. The paper investigates whether LLMs can serve as lightweight assistants for this task.

Method: Two prompting strategies: (1) zero-shot mode relying on pretrained knowledge, and (2) meta-informed mode augmented with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Datasets are converted into interpretable metadata for LLM analysis.

Result: Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search. Meta-informed prompting shows improvements, demonstrating LLMs' capacity for in-context meta-learning.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional expensive search methods.

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ICPO框架，利用LRMs的上下文学习能力提供专家指导，无需依赖高级模型轨迹，解决了现有RLVR方法探索受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法（如GRPO）由于依赖当前策略分布的在线rollout，导致探索受限和轨迹多样性不足。虽然近期方法尝试引入专家模型轨迹来扩展策略覆盖，但这增加了计算成本且高级模型往往不可用。

Method: ICPO框架包含三个核心组件：1）混合策略GRPO与隐式专家强制，利用现有数据集通过上下文学习提供专家指导；2）专家区域拒绝采样，过滤不可靠的离策略轨迹；3）退火专家奖励塑形，平衡早期专家指导与后期自主改进。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ICPO持续提升了强化学习性能和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ICPO为LRMs提供了一个可扩展且有效的RLVR范式，能够在无需高级模型轨迹的情况下显著改善探索能力和训练效果。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Motivation: 推理延迟是大规模部署大语言模型的关键瓶颈，现有推测解码方法依赖二元化的草稿-验证框架且缺乏严格理论基础。

Method: 引入多基础推测解码框架，通过理论分析多模型令牌生成的交互关系，优化模型能力、接受长度和计算成本之间的平衡，支持独立实现和与现有技术集成。

Result: 在多个模型系列上的实验结果显示：LLaMA2-Chat 7B加速3.31-4.01倍，LLaMA3-8B加速3.87倍，Vicuna-7B加速4.43倍，Qwen2-7B加速3.85倍。

Conclusion: 多基础推测解码框架在保持输出分布不变的前提下显著加速推理，为推测解码提供了更通用的范式。

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展HOHL的理论基础，证明其截断版本的一致性并推导收敛率，验证其在更广泛学习场景中的有效性。

Method: 使用截断版本的高阶超图学习，通过多尺度拉普拉斯算子诱导的超图结构来强制执行高阶平滑性，并在完全监督学习、主动学习等不同设置下进行测试。

Result: 证明了截断HOHL的一致性，推导了显式收敛率，在主动学习和非几何结构数据集中表现出强大的实证性能。

Conclusion: HOHL在不同学习设置中展现出多功能性和鲁棒性，为超图学习提供了更坚实的理论基础和广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种三阶段的贝叶斯域对抗神经网络框架，结合参数迁移和共享潜在空间适应，以解决深度神经网络在领域转移下的性能下降和不确定性量化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络需要大量高质量数据，但实验数据往往稀疏、有噪声或不足。迁移学习虽然有效，但参数迁移在领域差异大时性能下降，而域对抗神经网络缺乏不确定性量化能力。

Method: 三阶段框架：第一阶段在源域训练确定性特征提取器；第二阶段使用域对抗神经网络进行对抗性精炼；第三阶段在适应的特征提取器上构建贝叶斯神经网络，在目标域进行微调。

Result: 在合成基准测试中显著优于标准迁移技术，在矩形通道临界热通量预测任务中提高了预测准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: staged B-DANN方法能够改善预测精度和泛化能力，有望帮助核工程等其他领域。

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度网络中捷径学习（shortcut learning）的层间分布特性，发现捷径学习并非集中在特定层，而是分布在整个网络中。浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层则主要遗忘核心特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷径（虚假规则）在训练时表现良好但泛化能力差，是深度网络可靠性的主要挑战。但目前对捷径如何影响特征表示的研究不足，阻碍了设计原则性捷径缓解方法。

Method: 通过新颖的实验设计，量化由捷径诱导偏斜导致的准确率下降在各层的贡献度。在CIFAR-10、Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上，使用VGG、ResNet、DeiT和ConvNeXt架构进行反事实训练。

Result: 发现捷径学习不局限于特定层，而是分布在整个网络中。浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要遗忘核心特征。分析了局部化差异及其主要变化轴。

Conclusion: 层间捷径缓解策略分析表明设计通用方法很困难，支持采用数据集和架构特定的方法。

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

Conclusion: 多分类局部校准是解决现有校准方法在稀疏区域偏差问题的有效途径，提出的基于Jensen-Shannon距离的方法能够显著提升神经网络在多分类任务中的局部校准性能。

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

Motivation: 现有分布回归方法要么忽略概率空间的几何结构，要么计算成本高昂，需要一种兼顾几何精度和计算效率的平衡解决方案。

Method: 使用Bernstein多项式构建高斯分量的均值和协方差函数，通过控制点参数化概率轨迹，采用基于自动微分的优化方法最小化预测分布与经验数据之间的Wasserstein距离。

Result: 在包含复杂轨迹的合成数据集上，该方法在Wasserstein距离、能量距离和RMSE指标上表现出有竞争力的近似质量，特别是在非线性明显的情况下，轨迹平滑度和鲁棒性优于或接近替代方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了几何精度、计算实用性和可解释性的平衡，未来可扩展到非高斯分布、应用熵正则化加速计算，以及适应高维数据近似更复杂结构。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Conclusion: Curly-FM将流匹配模型扩展到超越种群建模，能够建模物理系统中已知的周期性行为。

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于奇异值分解和标准扰动机制的简单高效算法，用于在差分隐私下计算矩阵前r个奇异向量的张成空间，其误差仅取决于秩r相干性和谱间隙。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Hardt和Roth提出的问题，改进现有私有算法在密集设置下的性能，特别是在单峰PCA Wishart模型中达到与非私有最优算法相同的保证。

Method: 使用奇异值分解结合标准扰动机制，证明秩r相干性在高斯扰动下不会增加，从而保持输入相干性。

Result: 新算法在密集设置下显著优于现有技术，在单峰PCA Wishart模型中达到与非私有最优算法相同的性能保证。

Conclusion: 该方法为差分隐私下的矩阵近似提供了更优的解决方案，并展示了相干性在图问题中的应用潜力。

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAQuant是一种针对LoRA适配器的混合精度后训练量化方法，通过SVD重参数化将重要信息集中在特定行列，从而在保持高性能的同时显著降低存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然每个LoRA适配器本身轻量，但在大规模部署多个适配器时，聚合成本变得显著。需要一种方法在保持性能的同时减少存储需求。

Method: 使用奇异值分解(SVD)对每个适配器进行重参数化，将重要信息集中在特定行列，然后对重要组件使用高精度量化，其余部分使用超低位宽量化。

Result: 在LLaMA 2-7B、LLaMA 2-13B和Mistral 7B模型上的数学推理、编程和摘要任务测试表明，LoRAQuant使用的比特数显著低于其他量化方法，但性能相当甚至更高。

Conclusion: LoRAQuant是一种有效的LoRA适配器量化方法，能在显著降低存储需求的同时保持或提升模型性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Motivation: 可逆神经网络在逆问题中具有固有的稳定性和可解释性，但现有的贝叶斯视角优化策略各有局限性，需要新的正则化方法来恢复经典贝叶斯点估计器的特性。

Conclusion: 提出的正则化方法成功地将可逆神经网络训练与经典贝叶斯点估计器联系起来，为逆问题提供了稳定且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

Method: 为两阶段和单阶段多专家延迟设置提出新算法，选择性查询训练样本的子集专家，结合理论保证和标签复杂度分析

Result: 在多个领域的实证结果显示，算法显著降低训练成本而不牺牲预测准确性

Conclusion: 预算感知延迟算法具有实际价值，能够在保持性能的同时大幅减少训练开销

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ARC-Top-K压缩器，通过轻量级梯度草图对齐节点间的稀疏模式，实现免索引All-Reduce，在保持Top-K准确性的同时显著减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模分布式机器学习中的通信瓶颈问题，现有梯度压缩方法存在不足：Rand-K丢弃结构信息且性能差，Top-K保留信息但失去压缩特性且需要昂贵的All-Gather操作。

Method: 设计All-Reduce兼容的Top-K压缩器，使用轻量级梯度草图对齐稀疏模式，结合动量误差反馈(EF21M)实现线性加速。

Result: ARC-Top-K在理论上具有压缩特性，与EF21M结合获得比原始EF21M更快的收敛速度；实验显示在保持Top-K准确性的同时，训练时间减少高达60.7%。

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K结合了Rand-K的鲁棒性和Top-K的强性能，提供了高效可扩展的通信优化解决方案。

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在评估机器学习遗忘算法时，仅从同一训练模型多次运行算法会得到非代表性结果，因为不同训练随机数种子会导致算法性能显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习遗忘算法的实证比较通常从同一训练模型多次运行算法，但这种做法可能无法真实反映算法性能，因为算法对模型训练种子的选择高度敏感。

Method: 通过分析不同训练随机数种子下机器学习遗忘算法的性能变化，评估算法对训练种子的敏感性。

Result: 研究表明，即使使用相同架构和数据集，某些遗忘算法的性能在不同训练种子下存在显著差异，单一训练种子的评估结果可能具有误导性。

Conclusion: 建议在实证比较机器学习遗忘算法时，应考虑不同模型训练种子带来的变异性，以获得更全面和代表性的评估结果。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在无线异构环境下基于过空中传输的联邦学习，提出了允许结构化模型偏差的SGD更新方法，通过非凸联合功率控制设计优化偏差-方差权衡，提高了收敛速度和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OTA-FL设计在无线异构场景下受到最弱设备的限制，导致更新方差增大，且先前对偏差OTA-FL的分析主要针对凸目标函数，而现代AI模型多为高度非凸。

Method: 开发了允许结构化、时不变模型偏差的OTA-FL SGD更新方法，提出了基于统计CSI的非凸联合功率控制设计，并采用连续凸逼近算法进行优化。

Result: 在非凸图像分类任务上的实验验证表明，基于SCA的设计通过优化偏差加速了收敛，并相比先前的OTA-FL基线方法提高了泛化性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在无线异构环境下有效解决了OTA-FL的偏差-方差权衡问题，为非凸目标的联邦学习提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私协方差估计方法在不同数据集规模下存在误差界限不最优的问题，需要一种机制能同时在大数据集和小数据集上达到信息理论最优的误差保证。

Method: 使用简单的扰动机制，对于小数据集通过投影到适当半径的核范数球来改进误差界限。

Result: 在大数据集上达到所有p-Schatten范数的最优误差，在p≥2时信息理论最优；在小数据集上获得改进的Frobenius范数误差O(√(dTr(Σ)/n))。

Conclusion: 该机制是第一个在纯差分隐私下达到谱范数最优误差的协方差估计器，在不同数据集规模下均优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了将Transformer参数记忆视为实体共现关联查找的传统观点，提出了几何视角，认为模型会自发形成全局实体关系的几何结构，即使这种几何结构不比简单的关联查找更简洁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，序列建模中的参数记忆被抽象为实体共现的暴力查找。作者质疑这种关联视角，认为模型实际上会形成更复杂的几何结构来编码全局实体关系，包括非共现实体之间的关系。

Method: 通过分析Transformer推理实例，发现模型必须合成自己的原子事实几何结构。同时通过分析Node2Vec连接，证明几何结构源于谱偏差，即使缺乏各种压力也会自然产生。

Result: 研究发现Transformer确实会自发形成优雅的几何结构，这种结构将复杂的推理任务简化为易于学习的几何任务。这种几何结构源于谱偏差，而非典型的架构或优化压力。

Conclusion: 几何视角的参数记忆鼓励重新审视知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域的默认直觉，并指出实践者仍有空间使Transformer记忆更具几何性。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Motivation: 传统量化方法在激活量化到8比特以下时精度会急剧下降，需要新的方法来维持模型准确性。

Method: STaMP量化在序列维度应用线性变换，利用语言和视觉数据的强局部相关性，并在每个中间激活中保留少量高精度token。

Result: 在最新的LVM和LLM架构上评估表明，STaMP显著改善了低比特激活量化，并与现有的激活和权重量化方法互补。

Conclusion: STaMP量化是一种有效的策略，能够在降低平均激活比特宽度的同时保持模型精度。

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Result: 在类别移除实验中，计算时间减少30.1%，内存使用减少42.2%，或F1分数提高2.5%

Conclusion: 提出的采样方法能有效平衡计算效率与影响函数估计准确性

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

Conclusion: FP16在强化学习微调中优于BF16，建议重新考虑精度权衡问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.
