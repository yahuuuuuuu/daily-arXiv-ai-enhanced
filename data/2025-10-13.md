*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了微调的传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM仅需少量数据微调即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何有效利用多模态大语言模型进行视觉理解任务，特别是在数据稀缺情况下，发挥LLM在动态上下文推理和语言引导提示方面的优势。

Method: 对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行综合比较，重点研究LLM在少量数据（少于1000张图像）下的微调效果。

Result: 微调后的多模态LLM在人工文本叠加检测任务上实现了高达36%的准确率提升，性能匹配或超越了需要大量数据的CNN基线模型。

Conclusion: 多模态LLM方法在数据效率和适应性方面具有显著优势，为低资源视觉环境中的跨模态学习提供了有效策略。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Human-VDM: Learning Single-Image 3D Human Gaussian Splatting from Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02851)
*Zhibin Liu,Haoye Dong,Aviral Chharia,Hefeng Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human-VDM是一种从单张RGB图像生成3D人体的新方法，使用视频扩散模型提供时间一致的视图，结合高斯泼溅技术实现高质量3D人体生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多视图扩散模型在3D人体生成中存在的视图不一致问题，提升生成质量。

Method: 包含三个模块：视图一致的人体视频扩散模块、视频增强模块和高斯泼溅模块。首先生成连贯的人体视频，然后进行超分辨率和视频插值增强，最后通过高斯泼溅学习3D人体。

Result: 实验表明Human-VDM在生成质量和数量上都优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从单张图像生成高质量的3D人体，解决了视图一致性问题。

Abstract: Generating lifelike 3D humans from a single RGB image remains a challenging
task in computer vision, as it requires accurate modeling of geometry,
high-quality texture, and plausible unseen parts. Existing methods typically
use multi-view diffusion models for 3D generation, but they often face
inconsistent view issues, which hinder high-quality 3D human generation. To
address this, we propose Human-VDM, a novel method for generating 3D human from
a single RGB image using Video Diffusion Models. Human-VDM provides temporally
consistent views for 3D human generation using Gaussian Splatting. It consists
of three modules: a view-consistent human video diffusion module, a video
augmentation module, and a Gaussian Splatting module. First, a single image is
fed into a human video diffusion module to generate a coherent human video.
Next, the video augmentation module applies super-resolution and video
interpolation to enhance the textures and geometric smoothness of the generated
video. Finally, the 3D Human Gaussian Splatting module learns lifelike humans
under the guidance of these high-resolution and view-consistent images.
Experiments demonstrate that Human-VDM achieves high-quality 3D human from a
single image, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both generation quality
and quantity. Project page: https://human-vdm.github.io/Human-VDM/

### [4] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出两种通过调整初始噪声来减少文本到图像扩散模型记忆训练数据的方法，这些方法能促进更早脱离记忆吸引域，从而在保持图像-文本对齐的同时显著降低记忆化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型经常记忆和复制训练数据，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)来避免记忆化，但这会导致图像与提示对齐不佳。需要促进更早脱离记忆吸引域，以便在去噪过程中更早应用CFG。

Method: 发现初始噪声样本在决定脱离记忆吸引域的时间上起关键作用，提出两种缓解策略：1) 集体调整初始噪声；2) 个体调整初始噪声，以找到并利用能促进更早脱离的初始样本。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆化，同时保持了图像-文本对齐。

Conclusion: 初始噪声的选择对扩散模型的记忆化行为有重要影响，通过适当调整初始噪声可以有效减少记忆化而不损害生成质量。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [5] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究测试了AI生成图像中的代表性偏见，特别是职业场景中的性别刻板印象，比较了DALL-E 3和Ideogram两个AI图像生成工具的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在可视化创作方面提供了巨大机会，但现有研究主要关注创建过程和质量，忽视了代表性偏见问题。随着AI图像工具的广泛使用，解决有害的性别偏见对于确保媒体和专业环境中的多样化表征至关重要。

Method: 研究通过生成超过750张AI职业图像，使用主题分析方法来评估DALL-E 3和Ideogram两个工具在性别表征方面的表现。

Result: 分析结果显示，DALL-E 3和Ideogram都在AI生成图像中强化了传统的性别刻板印象，尽管程度有所不同。这表明AI可视化工具存在强化狭隘表征的风险。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要解决AI生成图像中的性别偏见问题，并为从业者、个人和研究人员提出了增加可见性别图像生成中代表性的建议。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [6] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在视觉自回归模型(VAR)中引入动态专家混合路由机制，通过尺度感知阈值策略减少计算冗余，在不损失图像质量的情况下实现20% FLOPs减少和11%推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型在递增分辨率下重复调用Transformer导致计算冗余，需要提高计算效率。

Method: 集成动态专家混合路由器，采用尺度感知阈值策略平衡专家选择，无需额外训练。

Result: 减少20% FLOPs，推理速度提升11%，图像质量与密集基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 提出的动态专家混合路由机制有效解决了VAR模型的计算冗余问题，实现了计算效率与图像质量的平衡。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [7] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，在LiDAR点云语义分割中显著提升了未知物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法依赖预测熵，但会混淆认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，导致将分布内模糊区域误分类为OOD。需要一种能准确分离这两种不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用层次贝叶斯建模对深度神经网络特征空间中的高斯混合模型参数进行建模，从中提取认知不确定性，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，相比现有预测熵方法，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降低到40%（减少36%）。

Conclusion: 基于认知不确定性的层次贝叶斯建模方法能有效提升无监督OOD检测性能，避免了认知和偶然不确定性的混淆问题。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [8] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-OSCAR：一种用于活动识别的分层开放集分类器，能够在保持最先进准确率的同时拒绝未知活动，并将未知类定位到最近的内部节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类活动识别中存在无法逾越的差距：生活中执行的活动范围与训练用注释传感器数据集能捕获的活动范围之间存在差异。未能正确处理未见活动会严重削弱任何HAR分类器的可靠性。

Method: 将活动类组织成结构化层次结构，提出Hi-OSCAR分层开放集分类器，能够识别已知活动并同时拒绝未知活动，允许未知类定位到最近的内部节点。

Result: 开发了新的数据集NFI_FARED，包含多个受试者执行来自不同背景的19项活动数据，完全公开可供下载。

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR不仅实现了开放集分类，还提供了超越二元"已知/未知"分类的洞察，促进了开放集HAR研究的发展。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [9] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于无监督聚类的高频振荡检测方法，在80-500Hz频段区分癫痫相关HFOs与尖波、背景活动和伪影，在控制数据集上达到97.67%敏感度和98.57%精确度，与手术结果相关性更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频振荡是识别癫痫灶的新生物标志物，但视觉识别耗时且主观，需要开发自动化检测方法用于研究和临床应用。

Method: 使用时频域S变换提取事件，采用无监督聚类技术对事件进行分类，区分HFOs与尖波、背景活动和伪影。

Result: 在控制数据集上敏感度97.67%、精确度98.57%、F分数97.78%；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点HFOs比率达0.73，与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: HFOs是癫痫患者癫痫发生的有效生物标志物，切除HFOs特别是快速波纹可达到无癫痫发作，而残留HFOs则导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

### [10] [Into the Rabbit Hull: From Task-Relevant Concepts in DINO to Minkowski Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08638)
*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究分析了DINOv2视觉模型的内部表示机制，通过稀疏自编码器构建了32,000个概念字典，发现模型表示具有功能专业化特征，并提出基于凸混合原型的Minkowski表示假说来解释视觉transformer的表征结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解DINOv2视觉模型内部表示的本质，虽然该模型被广泛用于物体识别、场景理解和动作识别，但其感知机制仍不明确。

Method: 采用线性表示假说作为基线，使用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)构建32,000个单元的概念字典，分析不同下游任务如何利用这些概念，并研究SAE学习概念的几何和统计特性。

Result: 发现功能专业化：分类任务利用'Elsewhere'概念实现学习否定；分割任务依赖边界检测器形成连贯子空间；深度估计使用三种单目深度线索。表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，字典趋向更大一致性，token占据低维局部连接集。

Conclusion: 提出Minkowski表示假说：token通过凸混合原型形成，这种结构基于Gardenfors概念空间理论，多头部注意力产生凸混合和，定义了由原型界定的区域，为解释视觉transformer表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

### [11] [PhyDAE: Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts for All-in-One Remote Sensing Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08653)
*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhyDAE方法，通过两阶段级联架构将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，能够精确识别和差异化处理多种异构退化（雾霾、噪声、模糊、低光），在保持成像物理一致性的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化恢复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，难以处理遥感图像采集过程中的复杂异构退化问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，包含渐进式退化挖掘和利用机制，使用残差流形投影器(RMP)和频率感知退化分解器(FADD)从流形几何和频率角度综合分析退化特征，引入物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，PhyDAE在四个恢复任务上均取得优越性能，全面超越现有最优方法，同时显著减少参数数量和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: PhyDAE在性能和效率之间实现了最佳平衡，为遥感图像一体化恢复提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Motivation: 解决现实临床决策中整合多种数据模态（医学文本、2D/3D图像、视频）的挑战，克服现有视觉语言模型在医疗领域开发中的不透明流程、数据稀缺和架构不灵活等问题。

Method: 基于统一的基于补丁的视觉编码器和LLM解码器构建，通过渐进式训练在1670万个样本上从2D扩展到3D和视频理解，采用医学感知的token缩减实现高效训练。

Conclusion: 通过开源完整流程，证明高性能医疗VLM可以透明实现，为可访问和有影响力的临床AI提供基础工具。

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

TL;DR: Puffin是一个统一的相机中心多模态模型，通过将相机视为语言来扩展空间感知能力，集成语言回归和扩散生成来理解和创建任意视角的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决相机中心的理解和生成任务通常被孤立研究的问题，旨在开发一个统一的模型来同时处理空间感知、理解和生成任务。

Method: 提出将相机视为语言的新范式，使用Puffin-4M数据集训练，结合全局相机参数和像素级相机映射，实现灵活可靠的空间生成。

Result: 实验表明Puffin在相机中心生成和理解任务上优于专用模型，并能泛化到空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导等跨视图任务。

Conclusion: Puffin通过统一的相机中心方法推进了多模态空间智能研究，将发布代码、模型、数据集和基准以促进该领域发展。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

TL;DR: 提出结构化输出正则化(SOR)框架，通过冻结内部网络结构并使用组套索和L1惩罚，在少样本医学图像分类任务中实现竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习冻结部分权重并添加任务特定层，虽然计算高效但限制了模型适应领域特定特征的能力，在数据有限时仍可能导致过拟合。

Method: SOR框架冻结内部网络结构(如卷积滤波器)，同时使用组套索和L1惩罚的组合，以最少的额外参数为特定数据定制模型。

Result: 在三个少样本医学图像分类任务中，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4基础网络，相比现有基准取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: SOR是一个简单有效的框架，可广泛应用于迁移学习任务，能够适应各种网络组件如卷积滤波器或神经网络块。

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

TL;DR: BEAR是一个全面的多模态大语言模型具身能力评估基准，包含4,469个跨14个领域的图像-视频-文本任务，涵盖从低级感知到高级规划的6个类别。研究发现现有MLLMs在具身能力方面存在持续局限，并提出了BEAR-Agent来增强这些能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试主要关注特定领域如规划或空间理解，缺乏对多模态大语言模型具身能力的全面系统性评估。

Method: 提出了BEAR基准，包含4,469个跨14个领域的图像-视频-文本任务，涵盖6个类别。同时开发了BEAR-Agent，集成预训练视觉模型来增强MLLM的感知、3D理解和规划能力。

Result: 对20个代表性MLLMs的评估显示它们在所有具身能力领域都存在持续局限。BEAR-Agent显著提升了MLLM在BEAR基准上的表现，实现了9.12%的绝对增益和17.5%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 提高MLLM的具身能力可以有益于模拟环境中的具身任务，BEAR基准为全面评估MLLM的具身能力提供了系统框架。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生物视觉机制（中央-外周处理、眼跳运动、皮层填充）的对抗防御框架，通过强化学习引导的眼跳选择性采样多视角图像块，重构后进行分类，无需重新训练分类器即可提升系统鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗防御方法依赖计算密集的优化，而人类视觉系统通过进化机制天然具有对抗扰动的鲁棒性。研究假设注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码是这种鲁棒性的关键。

Method: 结合三种生物机制：中央-外周处理、眼跳运动和皮层填充。使用强化学习引导的眼跳选择性地捕捉多个中央-外周视角，将这些视角整合成重构图像后再进行分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法能提升多种分类器和攻击类型下的系统鲁棒性，同时相比生物和非生物启发的防御技术显著降低训练开销。

Conclusion: 生物启发的预处理能有效缓解对抗噪声，保持语义完整性，且无需重新训练下游分类器，可与现有系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

inference times as low as 44 ms with model sizes under 350 MB, highlighting its
deployability in safety-critical contexts. Results from experiments with a real
robot and test datasets indicate that a VGG19 model trained on thermal imaging
performs best.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinearSR是一个基于线性注意力的图像超分辨率框架，首次系统性解决了线性注意力在超分辨率中的关键挑战，包括训练不稳定性、感知-失真权衡问题，实现了高效且高质量的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式图像超分辨率模型依赖自注意力的二次复杂度，计算开销大。线性注意力提供线性复杂度解决方案，但之前存在训练不稳定、感知-失真权衡等未解决的关键挑战。

Method: 提出LinearSR框架：1）基于"拐点"的早期停止引导微调策略解决训练不稳定性；2）SNR-based混合专家架构缓解感知-失真权衡；3）基于"精度优先于数量"原则的轻量级引导范式TAG。

Result: LinearSR同时实现了最先进的感知质量和卓越效率。其核心扩散前向传播达到SOTA级速度，整体多步推理时间保持高度竞争力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为线性注意力在真实感超分辨率领域的应用提供了首个稳健方法，为高效生成式超分辨率的未来研究建立了基础范式。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且具有侵入性，需要开发基于人工智能的非侵入性高效替代方案。

Method: 结合YOLO和Grounding DINO进行目标检测，使用光流模糊检测、DINOv2图像编码和聚类方法，从视频中提取代表性关键帧。

Result: 所提出的关键帧选择方法在kākā重识别任务中实现了高准确率，为在更具挑战性环境中收集的媒体数据研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 这种基于人工智能和计算机视觉的非侵入性方法为野生动物监测提供了有价值的替代方案，有助于生态学和保护生物学的新方法发展。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router是一个用于通用视频质量评估的智能框架，通过多层级模型路由系统动态选择专家模型，解决了现有VQA模型在泛化性、可解释性和可扩展性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型存在泛化能力差、可解释性有限、难以扩展到新用例或内容类型的问题，特别是在处理用户生成内容、短视频和AI生成内容等多样化视频时表现不佳。

Method: 提出Q-Router框架，集成多种专家模型，使用视觉-语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态推理并集成最合适的专家模型，构建基于计算预算的多层级路由系统。

Result: Q-Router在多个基准测试中匹配或超越了最先进的VQA模型，显著提高了泛化性和可解释性，在Q-Bench-Video基准上表现优异，并能有效定位时空伪影。

Conclusion: Q-Router展示了作为下一代VQA系统基础的潜力，能够结合专家模型的互补优势，在异构视频源和任务中提供灵活且鲁棒的性能，并有望作为视频生成模型后训练阶段的奖励函数。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

TL;DR: 提出了一个解决医学视觉问答挑战的框架，包含三个关键贡献：统一的多层次模态对齐、硬负样本挖掘方法和门控交叉注意力模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Med-VQA方法在模态对齐方面缺乏统一解决方案，硬负样本问题研究不足，且知识融合技术可能引入无关信息。

Method: 1) 使用对比学习和最优传输理论实现多层次、多模态、多视图和多阶段的统一模态对齐；2) 采用软标签进行硬负样本挖掘；3) 设计门控交叉注意力模块集成答案词汇作为先验知识。

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等常用Med-VQA数据集上超越了先前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一模态对齐、硬负样本挖掘和知识选择机制，有效提升了医学视觉问答的性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR是一种加速视频超分辨率的方法，通过识别低细节区域并跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的超分辨率方法在处理视频时计算成本高且速度慢，限制了其在高分辨率和长视频中的应用。研究发现视频中许多区域本质上是低细节的，从细化中获益甚微，但现有方法对所有像素进行统一处理。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，然后完全跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准超分辨率基准测试中，该方法在720p视频上比先前模型实现了高达60%的端到端延迟减少，且没有可感知的质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR是一种简单而有效的策略，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少了视频超分辨率的计算需求。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

<details>

Motivation: 将图像预训练的视觉语言模型扩展到视频领域面临挑战，因为需要处理密集且时间延长的视觉输入，超出了图像模型的能力范围。

Method: 提出动态压缩（自适应选择代表性帧和内容感知的空间令牌聚合）和问题分解（将原始查询重新表述为子问题）两种方法。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe有效提升了各种基准测试中的视频理解能力，在具有挑战性的长视频基准上表现出色。

Conclusion: D-CoDe框架在复杂视频语言任务处理方面具有潜力，能够有效解决视频大语言模型构建中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D实例映射到2D RGB-D图像，然后使用视觉语言模型进行分类，但这种方法会引入2D遮挡噪声，且在推理时产生大量计算和内存成本，降低推理速度

Method: 设计教师模型提取高质量实例嵌入，通过标签引导蒸馏算法将开放词汇知识蒸馏到3D学生模型中，学生模型可直接从点云分类实例

Conclusion: FOLK方法通过知识蒸馏有效解决了开放词汇3D实例分割中的噪声和效率问题，实现了高性能和高效率的平衡

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蔓越莓种植中的变化监测通常需要人工完成，耗时且效率低。深度学习虽有望解决此问题，但面临高维特征难以解释和需要大量人工标注的挑战。

Method: 使用自监督方法微调视觉变换器(ViT)，通过双重预训练任务(时间回归和类别预测)学习植物和果实外观随时间演化的潜在空间表示。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可应用于其他作物和场景，为作物生长监测提供了一种无需标注的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

*Daiki Yoshikawa,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP使用双曲空间的ℓ₁积度量来同时表达概念层次结构和跨概念组合性，解决了现有视觉语言模型难以同时处理这两种语义结构的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型虽然在大规模多模态表示学习上取得显著成功，但难以同时表达概念家族内的层次结构（如狗⊑哺乳动物⊑动物）和跨概念家族的组合性（如"狗在车里"⊑狗,车）。双曲空间能有效捕捉树状层次结构，但其对组合性的表示能力尚不明确。

Method: 提出PHyCLIP方法，在双曲空间的笛卡尔积上采用ℓ₁积度量。概念家族内的层次结构在单个双曲因子中形成，跨概念组合通过ℓ₁积度量捕获，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有的单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供了更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间的ℓ₁积度量设计，成功解决了同时表达概念层次结构和跨概念组合性的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了更强大的语义建模能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗攻击方法在分割模型间的迁移性较差，主要由于模型内部复杂的上下文依赖关系以及代理模型与目标模型间的特征分布差异。

Method: 将输入样本分割成多个局部区域，重新映射语义信息生成多样化增强样本，用这些样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留局部语义信息而非全局信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes两个基准数据集、四个不同分割模型和三个骨干网络上，SegTrans显著提高了对抗迁移成功率，平均提升8.55%，计算效率提升超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans在不需要额外计算开销的情况下，显著提高了对抗样本在不同分割模型间的可迁移性，优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ASVP方法，通过奇异值分解在图像修复模型的内部特征图中注入结构化高频扰动，有效防御知识蒸馏攻击，同时保持教师模型输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏攻击威胁深度模型知识产权，现有分类任务的防御方法难以扩展到图像修复任务，因为修复任务是生成式任务，具有连续高维输出，需要空间一致性和细节保留。

Method: ASVP方法在运行时对教师模型的内部特征图进行奇异值分解，放大前k个奇异值来注入结构化高频扰动，破坏蒸馏所需的对齐关系。

Result: 在5个图像修复任务上的实验表明，ASVP可将学生模型的PSNR降低高达4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，而对教师模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源图像修复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏提供了实用解决方案，相比现有方法提供更强且更一致的防御效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

TL;DR: 提出了Ro-Bench基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型在动态分布外反事实视频上的鲁棒性，发现现有模型性能显著下降，但通过反事实数据微调可提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务中表现出色，但其在面对操纵视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 创建Ro-Bench基准测试，包含通过编辑风格、对象、背景及其组合生成的高质量、多样化且时间相关的反事实视频数据，评估了8个最新的视频MLLM模型。

Result: 当前模型在反事实视频内容上表现出显著性能下降，但通过反事实数据微调可使Ro-Bench性能提升21.73%，在MVBench数据集的20个任务上提升12.78%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据能有效增强MLLM的视频理解能力，证明了其在提升模型鲁棒性方面的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Motivation: 现代农业监测系统依赖多源数据，但无人机动物健康监测面临数据稀缺问题，包括动物小尺寸、遮挡和部分可见等场景特定问题。迁移学习方法因缺乏反映特定农场条件的大型数据集而效果有限。

Method: 提出对象聚焦的数据增强框架：分割动物与背景，通过变换和基于扩散的合成技术创建真实多样的场景，增强动物检测和监测性能。

Result: 初步实验表明，增强后的数据集在动物检测任务上表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成领域特定数据，即使在数据稀缺情况下也能实现实时动物健康监测，弥合了有限数据与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)新范式，通过分解复杂感知问题为可处理的子问题，显著提升大视觉语言模型的视觉感知精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时缩放技术对视觉感知任务效果有限，因为当前LVLMs采用快速感知范式，将视觉理解视为一次性输出，缺乏对底层感知过程的建模。

Method: 提出PTS范式，鼓励丰富的token感知，将复杂感知问题分解为中间可处理的子问题，结合强化学习技术。

Result: PTS将DisTANCE基准上的高精度性能从8.0%提升至64.7%，在域外任务上泛化良好，即使使用纯合成数据也能提升数学推理和真实世界感知性能。

Conclusion: PTS通过增加感知相关token和提升对图像token的关注度，成功使感知与推理时缩放对齐，为LVLMs的视觉感知能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过为预训练的毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测可靠性，从而提高可解释性和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波姿态估计中，稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型从统计先验而非传感器数据推断关节位置，这种对先验知识的过度依赖会降低下游任务（如手势和活动识别）的性能。

Method: 引入mmJoints框架，增强预训练的黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器输出，添加关节描述符来显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测可靠性。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置下使用超过115,000个信号帧进行评估，mmJoints估计描述符的错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提升达12.5%，活动识别性能提升达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式建模姿态估计中的偏差，有效提高了姿态估计的可解释性和下游任务的准确性。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法精度有限，现有的多向量检索方法虽然通过分解查询和图像分段匹配提高了精度，但仍存在对齐不足和冗余计算的问题。

Method: 提出分层范式使用多个中间粒度来增强查询与不同图像对象的对齐，利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性减少冗余匹配计算，并为不同数据集自动配置参数。

Result: HiMIR不仅显著提高了检索精度，还将计算量减少了最多3.5倍。

Conclusion: HiMIR框架通过分层多粒度对齐和高效调度，在保持高精度的同时大幅提升了图像检索的效率。

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对生成手部区域的质量评估任务HandEval，通过HandPair数据集训练，利用MLLM和手部关键点先验知识，显著提升了生成手部的真实性和AIGC检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在复杂局部区域（特别是人手）生成准确细节方面仍有困难，生成的手部常出现结构扭曲和不真实纹理，但手部区域质量评估一直被忽视。

Method: 构建HandPair数据集（48k张高质量和低质量手部配对图像），开发HandEval模型，结合多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力和手部关键点先验知识。

Result: HandEval在人类标注测试集上比现有SOTA方法更符合人类判断，集成到图像生成和AIGC检测流程中分别显著提升了生成手部真实性和检测准确率。

Conclusion: HandEval是首个专门针对生成手部质量评估的模型，在多个下游应用中展现出普遍有效性，为提升AIGC质量提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI彩色化技术存在版权侵权风险，如未经授权对黑白漫画和电影进行彩色化并转售，但目前缺乏有效的防护方法。

Method: 提出Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma)方法，使用拉普拉斯滤波器优化不可察觉的扰动以保持感知质量，并在优化过程中应用多种输入变换来增强跨模型迁移性和对后处理的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低彩色化质量，同时保持视觉外观不变。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI彩色化的首个防御方法，为生成媒体中的版权保护防御开辟了新途径。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型由于顺序token-by-token解码过程导致推理速度缓慢，需要数千次模型前向传播来生成单张图像，需要解决这种效率低下的问题。

Method: 引入next-clean-token预测范式，通过低成本微调使预训练自回归模型能够接受噪声扰动token嵌入并预测下一个干净token；在推理时用高斯噪声初始化token序列，在嵌入空间进行迭代的next-clean-token预测，使用概率准则并行验证和接受多个token。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够通过减少模型前向传播次数来加速生成，同时保持生成图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: SJD2框架成功将去噪过程与Jacobi迭代结合，实现了自回归模型的并行token生成，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了生成效率。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著减少了大视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有方法协同工作。

Conclusion: 通过修改视觉编码器来识别和屏蔽不确定视觉标记，是减轻物体幻觉的有效策略。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Conclusion: 提出的熵信息解码策略能够在不增加额外计算开销的情况下，显著改善自回归图像生成的性能表现。

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR标注通常存在噪声，这些噪声在领域偏移下会进一步放大，威胁系统可靠性。虽然图像中的噪声标签学习已有研究，但在3D LiDAR分割中的领域泛化问题尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出DuNe双视图框架，包含强分支和弱分支，通过特征级一致性约束和基于置信度过滤的交叉熵损失来处理噪声标签。

Result: 在10%对称标签噪声下，在SemanticKITTI上达到56.86% mIoU，nuScenes上42.28%，SemanticPOSS上52.58%，算术平均49.57%，调和平均48.50%。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS-NL任务中表现出强大的领域泛化能力，显著优于现有噪声标签学习方法。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

### [41] [Improving the Performance of Unimodal Dynamic Hand-Gesture Recognition with Multimodal Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06145)
*Mahdi Abavisani,Hamid Reza Vaezi Joze,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种通过多模态知识训练单模态3D-CNN的方法，用于动态手势识别，通过时空语义对齐损失实现模态间特征对齐，避免负知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常显式组合多模态信息，本文旨在将多模态知识嵌入到单模态网络中，使每个单模态网络都能获得性能提升。

Method: 为每个模态分配独立网络，通过时空语义对齐损失(SSA)强制网络协作学习共同语义和更好表示，并使用焦点正则化参数避免负知识迁移。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法提高了单模态网络的测试时识别准确率，并在多个动态手势识别数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功将多模态知识嵌入单模态网络，实现了无需显式多模态融合的改进性能，为动态手势识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse
representation-based classification (SRC) method. The proposed network consists
of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

Motivation: 现有法向量估计方法在建模细粒度几何结构方面存在不足，而现有的Mamba方法主要关注全局形状结构，对局部几何细节建模不足。

Method: 提出注意力驱动的层次特征融合(AHFF)方案自适应融合多尺度点云补丁特征，并构建补丁级状态空间模型(PSSM)将点云补丁建模为隐式超曲面。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和灵活性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit通过局部几何细节的有效建模，显著提升了点云法向量估计的性能。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Method: 采用GL-DT框架，包含时空特征融合模块联合建模运动和外观特征，结合全局-局部协作检测策略增强小目标检测，并引入JPTrack跟踪算法减少ID切换和轨迹断裂问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持实时性能的同时，显著提高了多目标跟踪的连续性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机检测跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持，有效解决了复杂场景下的多目标跟踪挑战。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

TL;DR: 提出Dense2MoE方法，将密集的扩散变换器转换为混合专家结构，通过结构化稀疏化减少激活参数60%，同时保持原始性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器参数量大导致推理开销高，现有剪枝方法会因模型容量减少导致性能下降，需要一种既能减少激活参数又能保持模型容量的方法。

Method: 将DiT块中的前馈网络替换为MoE层，减少FFN激活参数62.5%；提出混合块选择性激活DiT块；设计多步蒸馏流程，包括基于泰勒度量的专家初始化、负载均衡的知识蒸馏和MoB优化的组特征损失。

Result: 将大型扩散变换器转换为MoE结构，激活参数减少60%的同时保持原始性能，在广泛实验中超越基于剪枝的方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOS是一个简单可扩展的数据合成流水线，通过对象中心组合策略将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中，使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照，产生准确多样的掩码、边界框和指代表达式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉分组任务需要大量标注数据，但真实数据标注成本高、存在偏差且难以扩展。合成数据有潜力但缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性。

Method: 基于对象中心的组合策略，使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照技术，将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中。

Result: 使用10万张SOS合成图像训练的模型在检测和接地任务上优于使用更大真实图像数据集（如GRIT和V3Det）训练的模型，在LVIS检测上提升+10.9 AP，在gRefCOCO接地上提升+8.4 NAcc。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控数据集构建，在低数据和封闭词汇设置下都能改善泛化能力。将LVIS和COCO与合成对象片段结合可在各种真实数据规模下获得强劲性能，在极有限真实数据下增益更大。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Motivation: 计算病理学中细胞和细胞核分割面临标注数据稀缺的挑战，特别是对于罕见或非典型形态。手动标注成本高昂，合成数据提供了一种经济有效的替代方案。

Method: 使用多模态语义扩散模型MSDM，通过细胞/细胞核形态图、RGB颜色特征和BERT编码的元数据来条件化生成过程，并通过多头交叉注意力整合这些异构模态。

Result: 合成图像与真实数据高度匹配，在匹配生物条件下生成图像与真实图像的嵌入之间具有低Wasserstein距离。加入合成样本显著提高了分割模型在柱状细胞上的准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强方法有效提升了细胞和细胞核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSepT是一种可分离的正交变换，通过张量积构造DCT径向基和傅里叶谐波角向基，解决了极坐标中的不可分离性障碍，大幅降低了计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交矩图像表示方法存在高计算复杂度和数值不稳定性问题，特别是在大阶数时，Zernike和伪Zernike矩需要耦合的径向-角向处理，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出PSepT变换，使用离散余弦变换(DCT)径向基和傅里叶谐波角向基的张量积构造，实现完全核分解，支持独立的径向和角向处理。

Result: 计算复杂度从O(n^3N^2)降至O(N^2 log N)，内存需求降至O(N^2)，条件数缩放降至O(√N)，在结构化数据集上表现出更好的数值稳定性和计算效率。

Conclusion: PSepT的可分离框架使得高阶矩分析成为可能，为稳健的图像分析应用开辟了新途径，同时保持精确重构能力。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

Method: 探索训练特征归因方法，该方法将测试预测与特定训练图像的特定区域联系起来。

Result: 在视觉数据集上的实验表明，训练特征归因能够提供细粒度的、测试特定的解释：识别导致错误分类的有害示例，并揭示传统归因方法未能暴露的虚假相关性（如基于补丁的捷径）。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因为深度模型的内部工作机制提供了新的见解，能够识别传统方法无法检测到的有害模式和虚假相关性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

Conclusion: 该图像支气管镜拓扑定位方法为支气管镜检查提供了有效的导航辅助，无需患者CT扫描，仅需模拟数据训练，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

Motivation: 实例级识别(ILR)需要识别单个对象而非类别，但创建大规模标注数据集具有挑战性，限制了ILR在现实世界中的应用。

Method: 从多个领域合成生成多样化的对象实例，无需依赖任何真实图像，通过微调基础视觉模型来提升性能。

Result: 在七个ILR基准测试中显著提高了检索性能，涵盖多个领域。

Conclusion: 该方法为ILR提供了一种高效有效的替代方案，仅需目标领域名称即可生成训练数据，为现实应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

Motivation: 传统目标检测器局限于'封闭世界'假设，无法处理现实场景中的未知物体。虽然开放集检测方法能将未知实例识别为'Unknown'，但这还不够充分。为安全关键应用提供更细粒度的未知物体分类（如'未知动物'vs'未知碎片'）能显著提升决策质量。

Method: TARO采用独特架构：基于sparsemax的物体性建模头、层次引导的重标记组件提供辅助监督、学习层次关系的分类模块。通过语义层次结构将未知物体归类到粗粒度父类别。

Result: 实验显示TARO能将29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别，显著减少未知与已知类别间的混淆，在未知召回率和已知mAP方面均取得竞争性表现。

Conclusion: TARO框架成功解决了开放世界目标检测中未知物体粗粒度分类的问题，为安全关键应用提供了更实用的未知物体识别能力。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了在线视频深度估计方法oVDA，通过借鉴LLM的缓存和掩码技术，解决了VDA无法在线处理的问题，在精度和VRAM使用上优于现有方法，并在边缘设备上实现实时运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Video Depth Anything (VDA)方法依赖批处理，无法在在线设置中使用，限制了其在实时系统中的应用。

Method: 借鉴大型语言模型的技术，在推理时缓存潜在特征，在训练时使用帧掩码技术，实现在线视频深度估计。

Result: oVDA在精度和VRAM使用上均优于所有竞争方法，在NVIDIA A100上达到42 FPS，在Jetson边缘设备上达到20 FPS。

Conclusion: oVDA成功实现了高效的在线视频深度估计，特别适合在低功耗硬件上部署，将发布代码和编译脚本。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个可解释的驾驶员意图预测框架VCBM，通过多模态数据集DAAD-X和概念瓶颈模型来生成时空一致的解释，提升自动驾驶系统的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶系统与人类交互增加，决策过程的可解释性对安全驾驶至关重要。深度学习系统缺乏对环境和驾驶任务底层表征的理解能力。

Method: 构建DAAD-X多模态数据集，提出Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM)框架，使用transformer架构生成时空一致的解释，无需后处理技术。

Result: 实验表明transformer模型比传统CNN模型具有更好的可解释性，并提出了多标签t-SNE可视化技术展示解释间的解耦和因果关联。

Conclusion: VCBM框架通过概念瓶颈模型有效提升了驾驶员意图预测的可解释性，为自动驾驶系统的人机交互安全提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一个基于多模态深度学习框架的牛只行为识别系统，通过语义线索提升视频特征识别性能，在监督学习和少样本学习场景下均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牛只行为是动物健康和生产力的重要指标，现有视频监测方法在数据稀缺的行为识别任务中存在性能限制，需要开发更有效的识别框架。

Method: 基于CLIP大规模图像语言模型，添加时间整合模块，采用定制化数据增强策略和专用文本提示，解决预训练模型与真实监控视频间的领域差距问题。

Result: 在CattleBehaviours6数据集上达到96.1%的整体准确率，对进食、饮水和站立反刍行为的召回率接近100%，在少样本场景下展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中具有巨大潜力，Cattle-CLIP为数据稀缺条件下的牛只行为识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，用于提升光子效率成像中的3D重建性能，包括LOS和NLOS成像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间分辨系统中由于传感器量子效率低和高噪声水平导致的3D重建挑战，特别是在长距离或复杂场景下。

Method: 设计了专门针对时空瞬态测量的两种注意力机制：时空自注意力编码器探索局部和全局相关性，时空交叉注意力解码器在token空间中整合局部和全局特征。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界数据上的广泛实验表明，TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS两种实现均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TRT架构通过专门的注意力设计有效提升了光子效率成像的3D重建性能，并贡献了大规模合成数据集和真实世界测量数据。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

### [60] [Stable Video Infinity: Infinite-Length Video Generation with Error Recycling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09212)
*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Stable Video Infinity (SVI)方法，能够生成无限长度视频，具有高时间一致性、合理的场景转换和可控的流式故事情节。通过错误回收微调技术，让模型从自身生成的错误中学习，解决了训练与推理之间的假设差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法主要关注减轻累积误差，但仍局限于单一提示词外推，产生同质化场景和重复动作。根本挑战在于训练假设（基于干净数据）与推理时自回归现实（基于自生成、有误差输出）之间的关键差异。

Method: 采用错误回收微调技术，通过闭环回收将Diffusion Transformer (DiT)自生成的错误转化为监督提示。具体包括：(i)注入历史错误干预干净输入；(ii)用一步双向积分高效近似预测并计算残差误差；(iii)跨离散时间步动态存储错误到回放记忆中。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时保持与多种条件（音频、骨架、文本流）的兼容性。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调成功解决了长视频生成中的假设差距问题，实现了无限长度视频生成，在一致性、创造性和条件设置方面都表现出色。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

Motivation: 跨域序列推荐需要同时捕捉域内和跨域行为模式，传统方法难以有效建模复杂的用户兴趣演化。

Method: 使用LLM生成领域感知的语义标签，将标签嵌入与物品标识符、文本和视觉特征融合，构建增强的物品表示，并引入标签增强的多注意力机制。

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上的实验表明，TEMA-LLM持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的语义标签和多注意力集成对面向消费者的推荐系统具有显著优势，展示了LLM在推进智能用户中心服务方面的潜力。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and
video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual
impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based
methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion
models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are
further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable

Motivation: 在医疗资源匮乏地区，肩部疾病的早期准确诊断面临挑战，需要低成本、易扩展的辅助诊断方案。

Method: 提出HMVDx框架，使用两个MLLM分别完成动作理解和疾病诊断任务，并引入基于医疗决策逻辑的可用性指标进行评估。

Result: HMVDx在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低成本MLLM在医疗应用中的潜力，为MLLM在医疗视频理解领域的应用研究做出了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

TL;DR: 本文建立了零样本图像隐私分类基准，对比了大型视觉语言模型与专用模型在隐私预测任务中的表现，发现VLMs虽然资源密集但准确性不如专用小模型，但在对抗图像扰动方面更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献倾向于采用为通用任务设计的大型视觉语言模型进行图像隐私预测，但缺乏系统评估，可能忽略了专用模型的性能上限。

Method: 建立零样本图像隐私分类基准，评估排名前三的开源VLMs，使用任务对齐提示，并与已有的仅视觉和多模态方法进行对比。

Result: VLMs虽然参数多、推理慢，但在隐私预测准确性上落后于专用的小型模型；但VLMs对图像扰动表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 大型视觉语言模型目前在图像隐私预测任务中尚未超越专用模型，但在鲁棒性方面具有优势。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

Motivation: 解决黑盒视觉语言模型在放射学图像问答中产生幻觉的问题，提高临床应用的可靠性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和GPT-4.1模型，在温度1.0下对每个问题回答15次，通过双向蕴含检查对意义等效的回答进行分组，计算语义聚类的相对频率得到DSE。排除DSE>0.3或>0.6的问题后重新计算准确率。

Result: 在706个图像-问题对中，基线准确率GPT-4o为51.7%，GPT-4.1为54.8%。过滤掉高熵问题(DSE>0.3)后，GPT-4o在剩余334个问题上的准确率提高到76.3%，GPT-4.1在499个问题上的准确率提高到63.8%。

Conclusion: DSE通过量化语义不一致性，能够可靠地检测黑盒视觉语言模型中的幻觉，显著提高诊断答案的准确性，为临床VLM应用提供了有效的过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Motivation: 现有LLM方法采样策略依赖手工启发式或外部关键帧模型，前者忽略重要时序线索，后者增加系统复杂度。

Method: 训练时使用[FIND]令牌通过时序令牌相似度匹配识别关键时刻；推理时采用时刻中心采样策略密集采样重要时刻、稀疏采样非必要帧；开发双向锚点更新传播机制提升跟踪稳定性。

Conclusion: 该统一框架有效解决了RefVOS任务中的时序推理和细粒度视觉理解需求，通过联合优化时序语句定位和视频目标分割实现了更高效准确的分割性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了视觉感知策略优化(VPPO)，通过令牌感知视角改进多模态强化学习，重点关注具有高视觉依赖性的关键令牌，在8个基准测试中显著提升多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理方法在RLVR优化过程中忽视了视觉感知的关键作用，需要从令牌感知的新视角来探索多模态RLVR。

Method: 提出VPPO算法，通过双重机制：基于整体视觉依赖重新加权轨迹优势，并仅对感知关键令牌进行策略更新。

Result: 在8个感知和推理基准测试中，VPPO相比领先的开源RL调优模型取得显著提升，在7B和32B模型规模上均验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 建立了分析多模态RLVR的令牌级感知新视角，提出了显著增强LVLMs多模态推理能力的新型优化策略。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

TL;DR: 人类视觉注视轨迹遵循类似动物觅食的Levy行走模式，这是一种在稀疏资源环境中优化的重尾步长随机轨迹。通过大规模眼动实验和CNN模型，研究发现人类视觉探索遵循与自然觅食类似的统计规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型强调基于图像的显著性，但眼动的时空统计特性仍未充分探索。理解这些动态对于注意力建模和视觉界面应用具有重要意义。

Method: 进行大规模人类被试实验，40名参与者观看50张多样化图像，使用高速眼动仪记录超过400万个注视点。训练卷积神经网络从图像输入预测注视热图。

Result: 分析显示人类眼睛的注视轨迹遵循类似动物觅食的Levy行走模式。CNN模型能够准确再现新颖图像中的显著注视区域，表明注视行为的关键组件可以从视觉结构中学习。

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循与自然觅食类似的统计规律，为通过生成和预测框架建模注视行为开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CapGeo框架，通过将几何图形转换为文本描述来提升多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力，并创建了CapGeo-Bench数据集来评估几何描述模型的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前先进的多模态大语言模型在几何推理方面表现不佳，瓶颈在于理解几何图形而非推理能力本身。由于几何图形可以用简洁的文本描述，将视觉内容转换为文本描述是一个有前景的方向。

Method: 引入CapGeo框架，通过几何图形描述辅助推理，连接视觉和文本模态。同时提出CapGeo-Bench数据集，包含4641个精心筛选的图形-描述对，并使用基于关键点的评估指标。

Result: 实验显示配备描述后模型性能显著提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升到59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升到73.0%。评估指标与下游CapGeo性能强相关。

Conclusion: 该框架和基准为推进多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Conclusion: 为未来6G网络的可扩展、节能和实时电磁数字孪生提供了有前景的技术路径。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

TL;DR: 提出Hybrid-depth框架，通过整合CLIP和DINO基础模型来提升自监督单目深度估计性能，采用从粗到细的渐进学习策略，在KITTI基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足而面临性能限制，需要更好的上下文信息获取方式。

Method: 1) 从CLIP和DINO聚合多粒度特征，在对比语言指导下设计代理任务进行深度感知特征对齐；2) 在粗特征基础上整合相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测，可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE流水线集成。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中显著优于所有最先进方法，所有指标都有提升，同时有益于下游任务如BEV感知。

Conclusion: 通过语言指导聚合CLIP的语义上下文和DINO的空间细节，有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，显著提升了自监督单目深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出IRCR-Net用于病理图像中的细胞核实例分割，通过实例感知一致性正则化机制解决半监督学习中实例级一致性不足、病理结构先验知识利用不充分以及伪标签噪声问题。

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例感知一致性正则化和先验知识利用，有效解决了半监督细胞核分割中的关键问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

Conclusion: PPFN方法能够有效处理热红外图像的单重和多重退化问题，并建立了高质量多场景红外基准数据集，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice是一个视觉中心推理基准，专注于从纯视觉内容进行推理，超越浅层感知，需要细粒度观察和分析推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理，将视觉输入视为可替换的上下文。为了填补这一空白，需要开发一个真正基于视觉内容的推理基准。

Method: BLINK-Twice包含三个核心组件：七种视觉挑战类型测试视觉推理、自然对抗图像对强制依赖视觉内容、带注释的推理链用于细粒度评估推理过程。评估了20个领先的MLLM模型。

Result: BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成重大挑战。现有语言空间的推理策略（如思维链或自我批评）可以提升性能，但往往导致不稳定和冗余的推理。重复图像观察能提高性能，主动视觉交互模型（如o3）显示了视觉推理新范式的需求。

Conclusion: 需要为视觉推理开发新的范式，现有模型在纯视觉推理任务上表现不佳，强调了视觉中心推理基准的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅方法严重依赖初始点云质量，在城市无界动态环境中，由于观测视锥体重叠不足，导致点云覆盖不均匀不完整，训练时会产生失真和伪影。现有密度化策略无法重建缺失结构。

Method: 1) 基于体素的可见性推理识别不可靠几何结构；2) 多样性感知视图选择选取信息丰富的支持视图；3) 基于块匹配的多视图立体重建恢复缺失结构；4) 在缺乏初始点的区域生成新的高斯基元。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的大量实验表明，VAD-GS优于最先进的3DGS方法，显著提高了静态和动态物体重建几何的质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS通过可靠的几何先验指导新高斯基元的生成，有效解决了3DGS在点云初始化不完整时的几何恢复问题，特别适用于具有挑战性的城市场景。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 准确量化森林生物量对碳循环监测至关重要。虽然机载LiDAR能捕捉3D森林结构，但直接从点云估计木质体积和地上生物量具有挑战性，因为需要建模长程依赖来区分不同树木。

Method: 提出Minkowski-MambaNet深度学习框架，将Mamba模型的选择性状态空间模型整合到Minkowski网络中，有效编码全局上下文和长程依赖，并加入跳跃连接以增强特征和加速收敛。

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模森林生物量分析提供了强大工具，推进了基于LiDAR的森林清查技术。

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Method: 1. SIBS：基于固定激活模式的启发式方法，预测神经元不活跃性；2. MGS：在预训练DETR基础上训练的轻量级门控机制，使用小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的实验表明，MGS实现了85-95%的激活稀疏度，在保持或提升性能的同时显著减少了计算量。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用的、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，能够在无需完整模型重新训练的情况下实现预训练视觉transformer的高效部署。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法在真实低光场景中难以有效利用时间信息来处理严重噪声问题。

Method: 第一阶段使用视觉状态空间块进行多帧对齐，恢复亮度、颜色和结构；第二阶段引入基于动态权重的时间聚合循环细化模块，通过光流指导自适应平衡静态和动态区域。

Result: 在真实低光视频上的实验表明，DWTA-Net能有效抑制噪声和伪影，相比现有方法提供更优的视觉质量。

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过联合利用短期和长期时间线索，成功解决了低光视频增强中的噪声问题。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 现有数据集不足以开发复杂自然环境中的感知系统，因为它们通常关注城市环境或物种数量有限，而森林管理需要先进的感知能力。

Method: 创建SilvaScenes数据集，在加拿大魁北克的五个生物气候域收集林下图像，由林业专家标注1476棵树、24个物种，并基准测试现代深度学习实例分割方法。

Result: 树木分割相对容易，最高mAP为67.65%，但树种分类仍然具有挑战性，mAP仅为35.69%。

Conclusion: SilvaScenes数据集填补了森林环境中树种实例分割数据集的空白，展示了树种分类的难度，为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型存在由跨模态单一主导特征维度引起的模态间隙问题，这些主导维度具有高预测敏感性，限制其影响可以改善校准误差。

Method: 提出维度熵最大化方法，通过正则化文本特征分布使其趋于均匀分布，从而减轻对主导维度的依赖。

Result: 该方法缓解了测试时提示调优中校准性能的退化，为VLMs在实际部署场景中的可靠性提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 维度熵最大化是提升视觉语言模型在测试时适应中可靠性的有效方法，通过处理主导维度问题改善了模型的校准性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Motivation: 解决动画和游戏产业中从少量人类设计角色生成无限新角色的问题，同时保持艺术风格和视觉特征的一致性。

Method: 基于DreamBooth构建，采用多token策略（使用聚类为单个角色和集体风格分配独立token），结合LoRA参数高效微调，移除类别特定正则化集，在生成时引入随机token和嵌入。

Result: 在五个小型专业数据集上评估，与相关基线比较，定量指标和人工评估均显示该方法能生成高质量、多样化的角色，同时保持参考角色的独特美学特征。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了从少量参考角色生成无限新角色的目标，人工评估进一步证实了其有效性，展示了该方法在创意产业中的潜力。

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Method: 提出了临床基础的评估任务和指标定义方法，构建了用于构建标准化评估管道的软件框架，评估了多种最先进算法在异质复杂任务中的表现。

Result: 发现最小化用户交互处理中的信息损失对模型稳健性至关重要；自适应缩放机制提升稳健性和收敛速度；验证提示行为/预算与训练不同时性能下降；2D方法在板状图像和粗糙目标上表现良好，但3D上下文有助于处理大或不规则形状目标；非医学领域模型（如SAM2）在对比度差和复杂形状时性能下降。

Conclusion: 提出了标准化的临床基础评估方法，揭示了交互式分割算法的关键性能特征，为开发更稳健的医学图像分割算法提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代MLLMs在具身AI中利用广泛常识进行高级规划，但其对物理工具的真正理解程度尚未量化，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含1000+图像-文本对的VQA数据集，评估32个MLLMs在工具识别、工具理解和工具创造三个难度级别的表现。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷，特别是在工具操作原理和创造性工具制造方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要开发更先进的模型来提升对物理工具的理解能力，论文提供了初步解决方案并公开了代码和数据集。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Motivation: 研究三星智能手机图像中存在的对角线伪影问题，以及这些伪影如何影响基于PRNU的相机源验证的准确性。

Method: 首先识别Galaxy S和A系列中共享的导致指纹碰撞的通用模式，然后对比分析PRO模式原始图像与普通图像的处理差异，最后探索对角线伪影在法证应用中的潜在用途。

Result: 发现某些三星手机型号存在导致PRNU指纹碰撞的共享模式，但支持原始图像捕获的设备仍可进行可靠验证；同时发现对角线伪影可用于减少HDR图像误检和在肖像模式图像中定位合成虚化区域。

Conclusion: 三星智能手机的对角线伪影会影响PRNU验证准确性，但原始图像可规避此问题；这些伪影在法证应用中具有实用价值，特别是在处理HDR和肖像模式图像时。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

TL;DR: PRNet是一个实时检测框架，通过保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征来增强小物体检测，包含渐进细化颈部(PRN)和增强切片采样(ESSamp)两个模块，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航空图像中小物体检测因像素表示有限导致特征提取时信息退化的问题，现有FPN方法的重建细节往往偏离原始图像信息，阻碍与语义内容的融合。

Method: 提出PRNet框架：1)渐进细化颈部(PRN)通过骨干网络重用和迭代细化实现空间-语义对齐；2)增强切片采样(ESSamp)通过优化的重排和卷积在下采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRNet在可比较的计算约束下优于最先进的方法，实现了更优的精度-效率权衡。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和利用原始浅层空间特征，有效解决了航空图像中小物体检测的信息退化问题，在保持实时性的同时提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Motivation: 传统多层感知机作为隐式神经表示进行变形时，需要昂贵的正则化来保证连贯性和准确性，这会导致训练不稳定并阻碍有效的特征对齐。

Method: 将变形重新定义为微分向量流的构造，通过将结构流属性直接编码到网络架构中，自然地确保连续性、可逆性和时间一致性。

Conclusion: 基于流的变形方法能够产生原则性和稳定的变换，实现准确且结构保持的2D图像和3D形状变形。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

TL;DR: TC-LoRA是一种新的可控扩散模型范式，通过超网络实时生成LoRA适配器，在扩散过程的每个步骤中动态调整模型权重，实现上下文感知的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可控扩散模型使用静态架构修改中间激活来注入条件指导，这种固定策略无法适应多阶段去噪过程的动态特性，限制了模型在生成过程中从粗结构到细细节的适应能力。

Method: 使用超网络基于时间和用户条件实时生成LoRA适配器，直接条件化模型权重，为冻结的主干网络在每个扩散步骤中定制权重修改。

Result: 在各种数据域上的实验表明，这种动态参数控制相比静态激活方法显著提高了生成保真度和空间条件遵循能力。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA建立了一种替代方法，通过更深层的功能权重适应来修改模型的调节策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求保持一致。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于蒸馏的框架，通过从预训练的小型动作模型转移知识，为视觉语言模型赋予动作执行能力，显著降低训练成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言动作模型虽然提升了机器人操作的泛化能力，但从头训练成本高昂。需要一种高效的方法来为预训练视觉语言模型添加动作执行能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：1) 轻量级对齐，将VLM隐藏状态映射到小型动作模型的动作空间；2) 选择性微调语言模型、状态编码器和动作模块。添加动作token和状态编码器来整合物理输入。

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上达到97.3%平均成功率（提升11.8%），在LIBERO-LONG上达到93.5%（提升24.5%）。真实世界实验中，在五个操作任务上达到82.0%成功率（提升17%）。

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏方法能有效使视觉语言模型生成精确动作，同时大幅降低训练成本，在仿真和真实环境中均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingVLM是一个专为实时处理无限视觉输入设计的视觉语言模型，通过统一的训练和推理框架，使用KV缓存和注意力机制来降低计算成本，在长视频理解任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理无限视频流时面临计算成本高、延迟大和内存使用过多的问题，需要一种能够实时稳定理解长视频的解决方案。

Method: 采用统一的训练推理框架，在推理时维护紧凑的KV缓存（重用注意力sink状态、近期视觉token短窗口和文本token长窗口），通过简单的监督微调策略在短重叠视频块上应用完整注意力来模拟推理时的注意力模式。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，StreamingVLM对GPT-4O mini的胜率达到66.18%，在单个NVIDIA H100上保持高达8 FPS的稳定实时性能，同时在LongVideoBench和OVOBench Realtime上分别提升4.30和5.96分。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM成功解决了长视频流处理的挑战，实现了实时稳定的视觉理解，其SFT策略还能提升通用VQA能力，无需特定任务的微调。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

Motivation: 背景网格对非结构化网格生成质量至关重要，但构建几何贴合、计算轻量且无伪影的最优背景网格具有挑战性。

Method: 将网格简化任务重新定义为边评分回归问题，训练GCN模型预测最优边折叠候选，使用考虑几何保真度和尺寸场精度的自定义损失函数。

Result: 简化后的背景网格元素减少74%-94%，尺寸场查询时间降低35%-88%，在复杂工程模型中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法替代了昂贵的程序化评估，加速了简化过程，为背景网格优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The sizing field defined on a triangular background grid is pivotal for
controlling the quality and efficiency of unstructured mesh generation.
However, creating an optimal background grid that is geometrically conforming,
computationally lightweight, and free from artifacts like banding is a
significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel, adaptive background grid
simplification (ABGS) framework based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).
We reformulate the grid simplification task as an edge score regression problem
and train a GCN model to efficiently predict optimal edge collapse candidates.
The model is guided by a custom loss function that holistically considers both
geometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy. This data-driven approach
replaces a costly procedural evaluation, accelerating the simplification
process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
across diverse and complex engineering models. Compared to the initial dense
grids, our simplified background grids achieve an element reduction of 74%-94%,
leading to a 35%-88% decrease in sizing field query times.

Motivation: 生成式AI在视觉语言模型方面取得了前所未有的进展，但缺乏一个将基于物理的渲染技术与扩散生成模型连接起来的统一框架。MCMC方法在从复杂高维分布中采样方面特别有效，可以作为连接这两个领域的桥梁。

Method: 通过分析梯度优化形成马尔可夫链的特性，结合MCMC采样方法，探索如何将基于物理的渲染技术整合到生成模型中。提供理论工具和实践演示来指导研究人员。

Conclusion: MCMC方法有潜力成为连接生成式AI和基于物理的渲染的关键技术，为实现物理真实的生成渲染提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has made unprecedented advances in
vision language models over the past two years. During the generative process,
new samples (images) are generated from an unknown high-dimensional
distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly
effective in drawing samples from such complex, high-dimensional distributions.
This makes MCMC methods an integral component for models like EBMs, ensuring
accurate sample generation.
  Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The
update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update
depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter
space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based
optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important
role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise
quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques.
  A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples
(images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven
manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still
missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of
these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge,
linking these closely related areas of research. Our course aims to provide
necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and
practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

Motivation: 动态线集的实时渲染在流场可视化和医学成像等任务中很重要，但实现高质量的全局光照和透明度在交互速率下仍然困难。

Method: 开发了高效的体素化算法，支持体素锥追踪和光线追踪的加速结构构建，并提出基于体素的剔除方法限制预处理范围到相机可见体素。

Result: 该方法能够实时渲染大规模动态线集，在渲染（半）不透明动态线集时，质量和性能均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的体素化框架实现了高质量、实时的动态线集渲染，具有物理准确的透明度，为相关可视化任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time rendering of dynamic line sets is relevant in many visualization
tasks, including unsteady flow visualization and interactive white matter
reconstruction from Magnetic Resonance Imaging. High-quality global
illumination and transparency are important for conveying the spatial structure
of dense line sets, yet remain difficult to achieve at interactive rates. We
propose an efficient voxel-based ray-tracing framework for rendering large
dynamic line sets with ambient occlusion and ground-truth transparency. The
framework introduces a voxelization algorithm that supports efficient
construction of acceleration structures for both voxel cone tracing and ray
tracing. To further reduce per-frame preprocessing cost, we developed a
voxel-based culling method that restricts acceleration structure construction
to camera-visible voxels. Together, these contributions enable high-quality,
real-time rendering of large-scale dynamic line sets with physically accurate
transparency. The results show that our method outperforms the state of the art
in quality and performance when rendering (semi-)opaque dynamic line sets.

Result: 在多样化室外数据集上实验表明，相比现有最优方法，本方法减少了背景伪影并提升了感知质量

Conclusion: 显式的背景分离不仅改善了新视角合成质量，还实现了自动的无物体环境贴图估计，为逼真的室外渲染和混合现实应用开辟了新可能

Abstract: Outdoor scene reconstruction remains challenging due to the stark contrast
between well-textured, nearby regions and distant backgrounds dominated by low
detail, uneven illumination, and sky effects. We introduce a two-stage Gaussian
Splatting framework that explicitly separates and optimizes these regions,
yielding higher-fidelity novel view synthesis. In stage one, background
primitives are initialized within a spherical shell and optimized using a loss
that combines a background-only photometric term with two geometric
regularizers: one constraining Gaussians to remain inside the shell, and
another aligning them with local tangential planes. In stage two, foreground
Gaussians are initialized from a Structure-from-Motion reconstruction, added
and refined using the standard rendering loss, while the background set remains
fixed but contributes to the final image formation. Experiments on diverse
outdoor datasets show that our method reduces background artifacts and improves
perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the
explicit background separation enables automatic, object-free environment map
estimation, opening new possibilities for photorealistic outdoor rendering and
mixed-reality applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全对齐技术往往过度谨慎，导致对良性提示也错误拒绝，需要在提升安全性的同时减少错误拒绝。

Method: 训练轻量级EBM模型，在推理时根据LLM内部激活映射到能量景观，使用能量函数梯度动态引导隐藏状态到低能量区域。

Result: 在ORB-H基准上，合规率从57.3%提升至82.6%，同时保持基线安全性能，显著降低错误拒绝率。

Conclusion: EDS提供了一种有效范式，使LLM能够同时实现低错误拒绝率和高安全性，将行为控制与核心知识解耦。

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

TL;DR: WILSON是一个轻量级后处理诊断工具包，通过检测Transformer内部表示在循环和重排序操作中的变化，来识别模型输出对无害编辑的敏感性，帮助在部署中预防故障并批准安全优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在实际应用中存在对无害编辑敏感的问题，如RAG输出随段落重排序而翻转、微调削弱预训练学到的恒定性、推理路径依赖提示顺序等，这些违反预期不变性的问题会破坏持续集成，迫使团队在安全性和速度之间权衡。

Method: WILSON结合了基于位置和层的无逆曲率映射（使用JVP和Hutchinson探针计算）与激活级交换子来标记重排序风险，这些信号计算成本低，适用于标准Transformer模型，并输出为阈值和CSV文件供编排器使用。

Result: WILSON能够实现具体行动：保护RAG免受顺序效应影响，捕获微调回归，稳定辩论路径和长多轮上下文，以及在部署中控制融合或重排序操作。

Conclusion: WILSON帮助预测故障并批准安全优化，使得可靠性和吞吐量能够在不改变模型架构或训练的情况下共同提升。

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

Motivation: 罕见遗传病诊断面临三大挑战：患者数据不足、全基因组测序不可及、致病基因数量庞大，导致诊断延迟和治疗不当，尤其在资源有限地区问题更为严重。

Method: 提出RareNet，一种基于子图的图神经网络方法，仅使用患者表型数据来识别最可能的致病基因，并检索相关的患者子图用于临床调查。

Result: 在两个生物医学数据集上的综合评估显示，RareNet在致病基因预测方面具有竞争力和鲁棒性，与其他框架集成时能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: RareNet仅需表型数据即可实现先进的基因分析，特别适合缺乏基因组基础设施的服务不足人群，实现了基因诊断的民主化。

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架能够在资源受限和易受干扰的环境中实现可靠的3D重建，为关键边缘应用提供支持。

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现实世界时间序列具有复杂的非平稳特性，导致分布偏移，现有实例归一化方法无法处理实例内的分布偏移，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出两种点级方法：LD通过在不同时间步使用不同参数拟合输入输出的内部分布；LCD使用神经网络预测输出的缩放系数。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中与不同骨干模型结合进行评估，证明了点级范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 点级方法能有效解决时间序列预测中的实例内分布偏移问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了高维数据可视化中常用的质量指标（标准化应力和KL散度）对尺度变化的敏感性，并提出了一种简单方法使这些指标具有尺度不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据可视化中常用的质量指标对均匀缩放敏感，即使缩放不会实质改变投影的视觉特性，这影响了降维技术评估的准确性。

Method: 通过分析和实证研究尺度对应力和KL散度的影响，提出了一种简单技术使这两个指标具有尺度不变性。

Result: 研究表明应力和KL散度值会随尺度显著变化，而提出的尺度不变方法在小基准测试中准确捕捉了预期行为。

Conclusion: 尺度敏感性会影响降维技术评估，提出的尺度不变方法能更准确地评估可视化质量。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

Conclusion: CATS-Linear通过创新的分类辅助机制和分解架构设计，成功提升了线性时间序列预测模型的性能，证明了线性模型在时间序列预测中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因组选择方法在处理复杂性状和大数据集时预测精度不足，需要更有效的模型来建模复杂的基因型-表型关系。

Method: 使用8维one-hot编码处理SNP数据，按染色体排序，采用PMF算法进行特征选择，集成CNN和自注意力机制构建DPCformer模型。

Result: 在5种作物的13个性状上测试，DPCformer均优于现有方法：玉米性状精度提升达2.92%，棉花纤维性状精度提升8.37%，番茄小样本场景PCC提升57.35%，鹰嘴豆产量相关性提升16.62%。

Conclusion: DPCformer在精度、小样本鲁棒性和可解释性方面表现优异，为精准育种和应对全球粮食安全挑战提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop
phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle
with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose
DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with
a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample
scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for
precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

TL;DR: 本文提出频率感知缓存(FreqCa)方法，通过分析扩散模型中不同频率分量的动态特性，对低频分量直接重用，对高频分量使用二阶Hermite插值器预测，显著降低扩散变换器的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器的高推理成本限制了其应用。现有特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步特征相似或连续，但实际中这一假设并不总是成立。通过频域分析发现，不同频率分量在时间步间表现出不同的动态特性。

Method: 1. 频域分析揭示低频分量相似度高但连续性差，高频分量连续性好但相似度低；2. 提出FreqCa方法：低频分量直接重用，高频分量使用二阶Hermite插值器预测；3. 提出缓存累积残差特征(CRF)，将特征缓存内存占用减少99%。

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev、FLUX.1-Kontext-dev、Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit等数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在生成和编辑任务中均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: FreqCa通过频率感知的特征重用和预测策略，有效解决了扩散变换器的高推理成本问题，同时保持了生成和编辑质量。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于上下文学习(ICL)的均衡器在非平稳时变信道中的性能，提出了从经典自适应算法(如LMS、LRMS)启发的新型注意力机制，显著提升了在动态环境中的适应性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL均衡器主要针对静态信道设计，缺乏对非平稳时变信道的理论分析和实践验证。本文旨在探索ICL在非平稳问题中的能力，特别是时变信道均衡场景。

Method: 采用原则性框架设计高效注意力机制，借鉴自适应信号处理算法(如LMS、LRMS)来指导设计，提出多步梯度更新以改善长期跟踪能力。

Result: 实验结果表明ICL在非平稳MIMO均衡中表现出强大潜力，基于经典自适应算法启发的注意力机制显著提升了动态环境中的适应性和性能。

Conclusion: ICL在非平稳信道均衡中具有重要应用价值，基于自适应算法启发的注意力机制设计可为开发下一代具有更强适应性和鲁棒性的无线基础模型提供关键见解。

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然点预测器的反事实公平性已有研究，但预测集的反事实公平性在不确定性下的公平决策中至关重要却未被充分探索。同时，共形预测能提供有效的预测集但不保证反事实公平性。

Method: 通过对称化保护属性干预的符合性分数，开发了CF-CP方法，在保持共形预测边际覆盖性质的同时实现反事实公平。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，CF-CP实现了期望的反事实公平性，达到目标覆盖率，且预测集大小仅有最小增加。

Conclusion: CF-CP为反事实公平的不确定性量化提供了一种简单、无需训练的途径。

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型行为控制技术（如激活向量修改或权重矩阵更新）通常基于经验启发式方法，缺乏理论支撑。本文旨在为这些干预技术提供理论基础。

Method: 基于Dherin等人关于提示影响可数学映射为隐式权重更新的发现，将该理论推广到深度多块Transformer。推导出将提示信息压缩为独立于token的思想向量和思想矩阵的原则性方法。

Result: 提出的思想向量和思想矩阵为现有的向量和矩阵模型编辑技术提供了理论解释，并提供了将文本输入转化为可重用权重更新的计算方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为语言模型内部状态干预技术建立了理论基础，揭示了这些技术如何从Transformer架构的基本计算中自然产生，为模型控制提供了更原则性的方法。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

Result: 通过模拟实验和阿尔茨海默病案例研究验证了方法的有效性，能够揭示样本获得相同预测的不同机制。

Conclusion: SHAP值聚类提供了一种有效解释黑盒模型预测的方法，能够增强模型在高风险应用中的可信度，并提出了多分类瀑布图的新泛化形式。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

Result: 在M5数据集上的实证评估发现，更高的频谱可预测性不仅与改进的预测精度强相关，还与代理模型和原始预测模型之间的更高保真度相关。项目级归一化对于生成跨异质时间序列的有意义SHAP解释至关重要。

Conclusion: 该框架为最先进的集成预测提供了可解释的实例级解释，同时为用户提供了可预测性指标，作为预测及其解释的可靠性指示器，有效平衡了准确性与可解释性。

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个联邦学习框架，用于量化客户端内和客户端间的细粒度跨样本记忆化，揭示了FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FL记忆化检测技术一次只关注一个样本，低估了跨样本记忆化的更微妙风险，而集中式学习的细粒度方法无法直接应用于FL。

Method: 提出一个框架，使用细粒度跨样本记忆化测量来量化FL中的客户端内和客户端间记忆化，并进行两项研究：测量跨客户端的微妙记忆化和检查影响记忆化的关键因素。

Result: FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据多于客户端间数据，记忆化受训练和推理因素的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架成功量化了FL中的细粒度记忆化，揭示了客户端内记忆化更强，且记忆化受多种因素影响。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

*Mujin Kwun,Depen Morwani,Chloe Huangyuan Su,Stephanie Gil,Nikhil Anand,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOTION框架通过随机噪声平滑方法解决量化神经网络优化问题，替代传统的STE方法，提供收敛保证并保持原始量化损失的全局最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络优化面临根本性挑战，因为量化器是分段常数函数，梯度几乎处处为零，在量化阈值处导数未定义。现有方法如STE缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 提出LOTION框架，受Nesterov平滑启发，用无偏随机舍入噪声下的期望损失来近似量化损失表面，形成连续可优化的损失函数。

Result: 该方法在合成测试集和150M/300M参数语言模型上表现优于标准QAT（量化感知训练）。

Conclusion: LOTION提供了一个有理论保证的量化优化框架，能够收敛到局部最优，并在使用随机舍入噪声时保持原始量化损失的全局最优性。

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

TL;DR: 提出Spatial Deconfounder方法，通过将空间干扰转化为多原因信号，同时解决空间因果推断中的未测量混杂因素和干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间因果推断面临两个交织的挑战：未测量的空间混杂因素（如天气、污染）和附近处理的干扰效应。现有方法通常只解决其中一个问题而忽略另一个。

Method: 使用两阶段方法：首先通过具有空间先验的条件变分自编码器从局部处理向量重建替代混杂因子，然后通过灵活的结果模型估计因果效应。

Result: 在包含处理干扰的SpaCE基准套件上验证，该方法在环境健康和社会科学数据集上持续改进效应估计。

Conclusion: 通过将干扰转化为多原因信号，该框架连接了空间和去混杂文献，推进了结构化数据中的稳健因果推断。

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

TL;DR: 结合虚拟成像工具和强化学习优化CT协议，在保证图像质量的同时减少辐射剂量，比传统穷举方法节省79.7%的计算步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CT协议优化方法需要穷举测试参数组合，计算成本高且不实用，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 使用虚拟成像工具模拟人体肝脏病变模型，结合PPO强化学习算法优化CT采集和重建参数（管电压、管电流、重建核、层厚、像素大小），目标是最大化肝脏病变的可检测性指数(d')。

Result: 强化学习方法在所有测试案例中都达到了全局最大d'值，且比穷举搜索节省了79.7%的计算步骤，显示出准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: 将虚拟成像工具与强化学习相结合的方法在CT协议优化中具有巨大潜力，能够高效实现高质量的图像重建。

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

TL;DR: 提出基于白金汉π定理的零样本迁移方法，通过无量纲空间缩放策略的输入输出，无需重新训练即可适应新系统环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习策略在面临新机器人、任务或不同物理参数环境时泛化能力差，限制了实际应用。

Method: 利用白金汉π定理将预训练策略的观测和动作映射到无量纲空间，通过缩放实现零样本迁移。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的环境中测试，缩放迁移在动态相似情境下无性能损失，在非相似情境下始终优于朴素迁移方法。

Conclusion: 量纲分析为增强强化学习策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力提供了强大实用的工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

TL;DR: 提出并系统评估了一种新的结构感知文本嵌入范式，通过在LLM内部编码过程中直接整合结构关系，而非依赖传统的后处理聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入模型通常基于原始文本操作，忽略了超链接、引用等丰富的结构信息，而这些信息在许多实际数据集中提供关键上下文。

Method: 研究了两种主要的内部处理方法：顺序连接和并行缓存，并引入了上下文蒸馏和语义平衡两种技术来处理噪声结构数据。

Result: 在检索、聚类、分类和推荐任务的零样本实验中，结构感知方法始终优于纯文本和后处理基线方法。顺序连接在噪声中等长度上下文中表现优异，而并行缓存在长高信号上下文中扩展性更好。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次全面分析了内部结构感知编码，为构建更强大和上下文感知的嵌入模型提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个框架，通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成的动作建议，让RL智能体学习何时遵循或忽略这些指导，在稀疏奖励环境中显著提升样本效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL智能体在稀疏奖励环境中难以探索有效动作序列，而LLM具有程序性知识和推理能力，但现有方法要么强制RL策略遵循LLM建议，要么将其直接纳入奖励函数，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成的动作建议，让RL智能体自主决定何时遵循或忽略指导，使用软约束保持灵活性，无需修改现有RL算法。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的BabyAI环境中，LLM指导的益处随任务难度增加而提升。在最复杂环境中，最终成功率相对基线提升71%，样本效率提升高达9倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用LLM的规划能力加速RL在挑战性环境中的训练，同时保持RL智能体的自主决策能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络函数逼近面临的三个主要挑战：(i)每个目标函数需要从头训练新模型；(ii)性能对架构和超参数选择高度敏感；(iii)模型在训练域外泛化能力差。

Method: 首先训练基神经网络逼近参考域上的多项式族，然后使用学习到的参数初始化复杂目标函数的网络。引入域映射机制将任意域输入变换到参考域，保持与预训练模型的结构对应。

Result: 在一维和二维设置中的大量数值实验显示，在训练效率、泛化能力和模型可迁移性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于初始化的策略为可扩展和模块化的神经函数逼近提供了有前景的解决方案，完整代码已在Gitee公开。

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

Motivation: 在现实应用中，智能体可能有隐藏的私有目标，需要在满足外部观察者期望的同时，秘密地优化私有奖励。本文旨在形式化这种欺骗性学习问题，并找到最优的私有臂识别策略。

Method: 将可检测性形式化为实际拉臂概率与观察者预期概率之间的逐步KL散度约束。将拉取公共次优臂建模为成功概率递减的伯努利过程，并提出受top-two算法启发的自适应探索算法。

Result: 在KL约束下，拉取公共次优臂最多只能以Θ(√T)的速率进行。通过最大化极小问题求解最优误差指数，提出的算法能根据公共次优性差距自适应调整探索策略。

Conclusion: 本文为欺骗性多臂老虎机问题提供了理论框架和实用算法，证明了在可检测性约束下，欺骗性智能体仍能有效识别最优私有臂，但探索速率受到严格限制。

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

Conclusion: PO-CKAN框架能够准确学习物理一致的解算子，验证了其在挑战性基准问题上的有效性，为参数化PDE的快速预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情绪识别方法依赖静态融合策略且假设模态输入始终可靠，这在真实学习环境中很少成立，需要更鲁棒的方法来理解学习者的情绪。

Method: 包含三个关键组件：跨模态注意力对齐模块实现动态跨模态上下文共享；模态重要性估计器为每个时间步的模态分配基于置信度的权重；时间反馈循环利用先前预测来增强时间一致性。

Result: 在教育子集IEMOCAP和MOSEI上的评估显示，Edu-EmotionNet达到了最先进的性能，并对缺失或噪声模态表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够捕捉情绪转换并自适应地优先处理可靠信号，非常适合在实时学习系统中部署。

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Conclusion: 紧凑的transformer模型能够直接从文本图表示中推断图论参数，为资源受限环境下的图分析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Google提出的Titans模型缺乏公开代码且原描述存在模糊性，阻碍了可复现性研究。

Method: 对Titans进行轻量级重实现，并在掩码语言建模、时间序列预测和推荐任务上进行综合评估。

Result: Titans因分块处理不总是优于基线方法，但其神经记忆组件相比仅注意力模型能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 确认了Titans模型的创新潜力，同时指出了实际局限性并为未来研究提出了问题。

Abstract: By the end of 2024, Google researchers introduced Titans: Learning at Test
Time, a neural memory model achieving strong empirical results across multiple
tasks. However, the lack of publicly available code and ambiguities in the
original description hinder reproducibility. In this work, we present a
lightweight reimplementation of Titans and conduct a comprehensive evaluation
on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks.
Our results reveal that Titans does not always outperform established baselines
due to chunking. However, its Neural Memory component consistently improves
performance compared to attention-only models. These findings confirm the
model's innovative potential while highlighting its practical limitations and
raising questions for future research.

TL;DR: FairTTE是首个用于评估医学影像中时间到事件预测公平性的综合框架，涵盖多种成像模态和TTE结果，通过因果分析揭示数据集中的偏见来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性方法主要关注医学图像诊断任务，忽视了预后场景中的时间到事件预测，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 整合先进的TTE预测和公平性算法，采用因果分析技术系统分析医学影像数据中的偏见来源，进行大规模评估。

Result: 研究发现偏见在不同成像模态中普遍存在，现有公平性方法缓解效果有限，分布偏移下公平性更难维持。

Conclusion: 需要针对所有偏见形式的整体方法，开发更稳健、公平的预后模型。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了自监督对比学习(CL)与仅负样本监督对比学习(NSCL)在表示层面的对齐性，证明它们在训练过程中保持相似性，但参数空间会发散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然理论表明CL损失近似于NSCL损失，但尚不清楚它们在表示层面是否在整个训练过程中保持一致。

Method: 在共享随机性条件下训练CL和NSCL模型，分析它们的相似性矩阵和表示对齐性，并提供理论保证。

Result: CL和NSCL的表示保持相似，相似性矩阵在现实条件下接近，但参数空间会指数级发散。对齐性随类别数、温度和批量大小改善。

Conclusion: NSCL可作为自监督与监督学习之间的理论桥梁，表示层面的对齐性随规模增强，但参数空间不稳定。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

*T. Ed Li,Junyu Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出自适应时间掩码（ATM）方法解决稀疏自编码器中的特征吸收问题，通过动态调整特征选择来学习稳定可解释的特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器训练方法存在特征吸收问题，特征相互吸收以最小化L1惩罚，难以一致识别和分析模型行为

Method: ATM通过跟踪激活幅度、频率和重构贡献来计算随时间演化的重要性分数，基于统计阈值应用概率掩码机制

Result: 在Gemma-2-2b模型上的实验表明，ATM相比TopK和JumpReLU SAEs实现了显著更低的吸收分数，同时保持优秀的重构质量

Conclusion: ATM为学习稳定可解释的神经网络特征提供了原则性解决方案，为更可靠的模型分析奠定基础

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种稀疏分解方法来分析人类视觉皮层中腹侧、背侧和外侧通路的神经表征差异，并开发了稀疏成分对齐(SCA)方法来测量大脑与深度神经网络之间的表征对齐程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么在单个任务上训练的深度神经网络能够很好地模拟整个视觉系统，尽管人类视觉皮层中的不同通路被认为执行不同的功能过程。

Method: 使用稀疏分解方法识别每个视觉通路中的主导成分，并开发了稀疏成分对齐(SCA)方法来测量大脑与DNN之间的表征对齐。

Result: 发现标准视觉DNN与腹侧通路的表征对齐程度高于背侧或外侧通路，SCA方法比传统的群体水平几何方法具有更高的分辨率。

Conclusion: 稀疏成分对齐方法能够更精确地捕捉大脑与机器视觉系统之间的潜在神经调谐轴，揭示了DNN与不同视觉通路之间的表征差异。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

TL;DR: 提出基于CNN的无监督多模态子空间聚类方法，包含多模态编码器、自表达层和多模态解码器三个阶段，探索了早期、晚期和中间融合技术，并在三个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态子空间聚类方法在处理多模态数据融合方面存在局限，需要开发更有效的融合策略来提升聚类性能。

Method: 使用三阶段框架：多模态编码器融合数据到潜在空间，自表达层获取亲和矩阵，解码器重构输入数据。提出了三种空间融合编码器和一种亲和融合网络。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，所提出的方法显著优于最先进的多模态子空间聚类方法。

Conclusion: 基于CNN的多模态子空间聚类框架通过有效的融合策略显著提升了聚类性能，为多模态数据分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for
unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of
three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal
decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent
space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing
the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding
to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The
network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original
input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion
techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for
spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are
essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition
to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is
also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different
modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets
show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
multimodal subspace clustering methods.

Conclusion: BPMI算法在固定计算预算下能够获得更高的预测精度，为多保真度高斯过程分类提供了有效的主动学习策略。

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

TL;DR: 提出了Dig-DEC，一种基于信息增益的模型自由决策估计系数，用于解决结构化观测决策问题。该方法移除了乐观主义，能处理对抗性环境，并在混合MDP中实现了首个模型自由遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于乐观DEC的方法只能处理随机环境，无法扩展到对抗性设置。需要开发一种既能处理随机和对抗环境，又能缩小遗憾界差距的新方法。

Method: 引入Dig-DEC，通过纯信息增益驱动探索，而非乐观主义。改进了在线函数估计过程，包括平均估计误差最小化和贝尔曼完备MDP中的平方误差最小化。

Result: Dig-DEC总是小于或等于乐观DEC，在特殊情况下更小。在混合MDP中获得了首个模型自由遗憾界。改进了遗憾界：从T^{3/4}到T^{2/3}(在线)，从T^{5/6}到T^{7/9}(离线)，在贝尔曼完备MDP中从T^{2/3}到√T。

Conclusion: Dig-DEC成功移除了乐观主义，能处理对抗环境，解决了Liu等人(2025)留下的主要开放问题，并在贝尔曼完备MDP中首次实现了与乐观方法匹配的性能。

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

TL;DR: 提出了ACPO框架，通过难度感知课程和基于归因的贡献度评估，解决RLVR中探索与利用的平衡问题，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习与可验证奖励方法在复杂推理中存在探索与利用不平衡问题，导致中间步骤信用分配不准确和过早熵崩溃，限制了模型性能。

Method: ACPO框架包含难度感知课程学习，使用轨迹语义分割和基于归因的表征来动态调节策略熵，同时采用因子化奖励系统精确量化每个推理步骤的层次贡献。

Result: 在AIME、MATH和AMC等具有挑战性的基准测试中，ACPO显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: ACPO通过平衡探索与利用，有效解决了RLVR中的信用分配和熵崩溃问题，为复杂推理任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种频域分析框架，将多臂老虎机问题重新表述为信号处理问题，证明了UCB算法中的置信边界项在频域中等效于对不确定频谱分量的时变增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多臂老虎机分析主要从时域和累积遗憾角度出发，难以刻画学习过程的动态特性，需要新的分析框架来理解探索与利用的权衡。

Method: 构建频域老虎机模型，将每个臂的奖励估计视为频谱分量，不确定性对应分量频率，将老虎机算法解释为自适应滤波器。

Result: 证明了UCB算法置信边界项在频域中等效于与访问次数平方根成反比的时变增益，并推导了关于探索率衰减的有限时间动态边界。

Conclusion: 该理论为经典算法提供了新颖直观的物理解释，并为设计具有自适应参数调整的下一代算法奠定了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

Method: 建立受车辆速度、密度和资源预留间隔影响的AoI计算模型，设计双路径优化方案：DDPG基于状态空间和奖励函数进行优化，LLM利用上下文学习生成最优参数配置。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM在积累少量样本后无需模型训练即可显著降低AoI，而DDPG方法在训练后能获得更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: LLM和DDPG的双路径优化方案能有效解决车联网中的AoI优化问题，LLM具有快速部署优势，DDPG提供稳定性能。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型需要针对不同场景进行特定训练，而基础模型存在对预训练分布全局均值的预测偏差，需要一种简单鲁棒的方法来处理小地球数据的时空预测问题。

Method: 通过表征和量化小地球数据的时空模式，然后利用表格基础模型进行跨场景的准确预测。

Result: 在三个典型场景的比较结果显示，该方法在大多数情况下比图深度学习模型(T-GCN)和表格基础模型(TabPFN)具有更高的准确性，表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为小地球数据的时空预测提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案，能够克服传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

Conclusion: AB-PINNs提供了一种灵活的域分解方法，特别适用于多尺度问题，能够动态适应解的固有特征并提高训练效果。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的测试时优化范式MATT，通过置信度引导的多推理路径生成来提升CTR模型的预测性能，特别是在处理低频特征组合时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTR模型优化主要关注训练阶段，忽视了推理阶段的优化机会。低频特征组合会降低预测性能，导致不可靠输出。

Method: 使用分层概率哈希方法估计特征组合的出现频率作为置信度分数，基于置信度采样生成多个实例特定的推理路径，最后聚合多个路径的预测分数进行鲁棒预测。

Result: 离线和在线A/B测试验证了MATT在现有CTR模型上的兼容性和有效性。

Conclusion: MATT能够解锁已训练CTR模型的预测潜力，通过测试时优化显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

*Haroon Gharwi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VARNN是一种用于时间序列回归的变异性感知递归神经网络，通过显式学习预测残差的误差记忆来重新校准后续预测，提高在非平稳、异方差时间序列数据中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳行为、机制转换和时间变化噪声，这些会降低标准回归模型的鲁棒性。

Method: VARNN在传统前馈预测器基础上增加学习的误差记忆状态，该状态从短期上下文步骤的残差中更新，作为变异性和漂移的信号，并调节当前时间步的最终预测。

Result: 在多个数据集领域（电器能耗、医疗保健、环境监测）的实验结果显示，VARNN相比静态、动态和循环基线模型实现了更优性能，以最小计算开销获得更低的测试MSE。

Conclusion: VARNN模型在漂移和波动环境下提供鲁棒预测，展示了其作为时间序列学习框架的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

TL;DR: LAGA是一个统一的多智能体框架，通过数据中心的图质量优化来解决文本属性图(TAGs)中稀疏性、噪声和不平衡问题，提升图神经网络性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN和LLM增强的GNN在文本属性图上对输入质量高度敏感，现有方法主要关注模型架构改进而忽视图数据本身的系统优化，导致实际效果有限。

Method: 提出LAGA多智能体框架，包含检测、规划、行动和评估四个协作智能体，形成自动化闭环。行动智能体采用双编码器和三目标设计来捕获跨模态互补信息并进行整体图质量增强。

Result: 在九个场景的实验表明，LAGA显著提升了图质量，并在各种任务和骨干网络上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 数据中心的图质量优化是实现可靠文本属性图和稳健图学习的关键。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in
artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data
annotation and model training remain significant. A fundamental objective of AI
research is to achieve robust generalization with limited-resource data. This
survey employs agnostic active sampling theory within the Probably
Approximately Correct (PAC) framework to analyze the generalization error and
label complexity associated with learning from low-resource data in both
model-agnostic supervised and unsupervised settings. Based on this analysis, we
investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data
learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration
optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了高维序列表示学习与高效贝叶斯优化之间的差距，为神经架构搜索、材料科学等领域提供了更广泛的应用可能。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture

Motivation: 探索学习优化器是否能够学习正则化技术，挑战传统显式正则化的必要性。

Method: 通过标准基准测试比较有正则化和无正则化的学习优化器性能，验证其学习正则化效果的能力。

Result: 正则化学习优化器在测试准确率和泛化能力上始终优于未正则化版本，并能将正则化效果迁移到新任务。

Conclusion: 学习优化器能够内在地学习正则化属性，质疑传统显式正则化的必要性。

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

TL;DR: 本文提出RLER方法，通过集成多个模型和自适应奖励插值与轨迹选择，解决了RLIR中的系统偏差问题，在无标签样本上实现了稳定的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法受限于标注样本数量，而RLIR方法虽然能在无标签环境下持续扩展，但存在性能不稳定和系统偏差问题，特别是模型倾向于高估高置信度轨迹，导致奖励估计偏差。

Method: 提出RLER方法，通过集成多个模型来聚合多样化预测，并采用自适应奖励插值和轨迹选择策略来缓解系统偏差。定义了三个偏差度量指标来分析问题。

Result: 实验显示RLER相比RLIR提升了13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，在无标签样本上实现了稳定的性能扩展。

Conclusion: RLER方法有效解决了RLIR中的系统偏差问题，在无标签环境下实现了接近RLVR的性能，具有很高的实用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

TL;DR: FedL2T是一个个性化的联邦学习框架，通过双教师知识蒸馏策略解决癫痫预测中数据异质性问题，在保护隐私的同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫预测需要大量EEG数据，但标注成本高且涉及隐私。联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但在患者间数据异质性下性能不佳。

Method: 使用双教师知识蒸馏策略，每个客户端同时从全局聚合模型和动态分配的同伴模型学习，采用自适应多级蒸馏对齐预测输出和特征表示，并引入近端正则化增强训练稳定性。

Result: 在两个EEG数据集上的实验表明，FedL2T在低标签条件下优于现有联邦学习方法，收敛快速稳定，减少通信轮次。

Conclusion: FedL2T为隐私敏感的医疗场景提供了可靠且个性化的癫痫预测解决方案。

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T)框架，通过(intent, constraint)对来引导蒙特卡洛树搜索，解决LLMs在多步规划中难以满足高层用户意图和符号约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法如CoT、ToT等虽然扩展了搜索空间，但经常产生不可行动作或幻觉步骤，无法确保规划与用户意图和约束对齐。

Method: 使用(intent, constraint)对作为结构化先验，压缩搜索空间并强制执行有效性，将Const-o-T集成到MCTS中，通过约束剪枝不可行分支并引导探索。

Result: 在Risk游戏、CAD代码生成和算术推理三个领域验证，该方法优于基线，获得更高准确率和更强的结构对齐。

Conclusion: Const-o-T为约束引导推理提供了可泛化的基础，使LLMs能够进行更高效、约束对齐和领域自适应的规划。

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

Conclusion: PlatformX是一个完全自动化和可转移的HW-NAS框架，克服了现有方法的局限性，为边缘设备设计高效深度神经网络提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code

Motivation: 现有方法通常单独进行权重剪枝或低比特量化，导致压缩率不够理想。需要一种统一框架来同时进行这两种压缩技术以获得更好的压缩效果。

Method: 使用spike-and-slab先验来诱导稀疏性，并采用高斯混合模型(GMMs)来建模量化权重以实现低比特精度。通过贝叶斯变分学习统一处理剪枝和量化。

Conclusion: 提出的SQS框架通过贝叶斯变分学习统一处理剪枝和量化，能够实现比现有方法更高的压缩率，同时保持模型性能，为资源受限设备上的模型部署提供了有效的压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

Motivation: 现实世界中的遗忘数据往往是低质量、重写或带水印的，这引发了遗忘方法可靠性的担忧，需要研究在噪声遗忘集下的遗忘效果。

Method: 系统性地在噪声遗忘集上基准测试最先进的LLM遗忘方法RMU和NPO，并提出基于显著性的解释框架来分析遗忘鲁棒性。

Result: 遗忘方法对扰动表现出惊人的鲁棒性，关键语义成分在表面形式变化下仍保持一致的遗忘驱动作用。

Conclusion: 遗忘算法主要受深层语义线索而非浅层词汇模式引导，这解释了其在噪声数据下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

TL;DR: 提出Value-State Gated Attention (VGA)机制，通过基于值向量的可学习门控来打破注意力与值状态之间的恶性循环，有效缓解极端令牌现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构中的极端令牌现象（如注意力汇聚和值状态流失）会降低模型性能、量化保真度和可解释性，这些问题源于注意力与近零值状态令牌之间的相互强化机制。

Method: 引入基于值向量的可学习数据相关门控机制，直接调节注意力输出，通过理论梯度分析证明该方法比基于输入嵌入的门控更有效。

Result: VGA显著减轻了注意力汇聚的形成并稳定了值状态范数，提高了模型性能、量化鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: VGA提供了一种简单、专用且稳定的架构机制，通过直接打破注意力与值状态之间的循环来有效执行'无操作'注意力。

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络调度研究主要关注固定宽度的静态端到端模型，忽视了适应异构硬件和运行时条件变化的动态方法。

Method: 采用分层设计：本地贪心调度器处理请求批处理和实例缩放，PPO路由器学习全局路由策略（设备选择、宽度比例、批配置），降低搜索空间复杂度。

Result: 相比随机任务分配基线，在牺牲准确率至最瘦模型（70.3%）时，平均延迟减少96.45%，能耗减少97.31%；在提高准确率时也能实现延迟和能耗的整体降低。

Conclusion: 该混合调度框架能有效平衡效率和吞吐量，适应异构硬件环境，实现延迟、能耗和准确率的多目标优化。

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

TL;DR: MagicDock是一个用于从头配体设计的框架，通过梯度反演和可微分表面建模解决现有方法的伪从头设计、有限对接建模和配体类型不灵活等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有配体设计方法存在伪从头设计、对接建模有限和配体类型不灵活等问题，需要开发更有效的从头配体设计框架。

Method: 采用梯度反演框架，将受体和配体的对接知识融入主干模型，通过结合预测实例化为反向梯度流来迭代指导配体生成；使用可学习的3D点云表示进行可微分表面建模；为不同配体类型提供定制化设计并集成到统一的梯度反演框架中。

Result: 在9个场景的广泛实验中，MagicDock在蛋白质和分子配体设计方面分别比最先进基线平均提升了27.1%和11.7%。

Conclusion: MagicDock通过梯度反演和可微分表面建模有效解决了从头配体设计中的关键问题，在多个场景下表现出显著性能提升。

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了近十年来AI系统训练的环境影响，发现即使采用优化策略，机器学习模型训练的环境影响仍在指数级增长，存在反弹效应，仅靠效率提升无法确保可持续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型性能提升，计算需求激增导致能耗和环境问题日益严重，需要评估现有优化策略是否能实现可持续的ML训练。

Method: 通过估算过去十年间包括大语言模型在内的著名AI系统训练的环境影响，重点关注显卡的整个生命周期分析。

Result: 研究发现两个关键趋势：显卡生产影响持续增加；ML模型训练能耗和环境影响呈指数增长，优化策略无法抵消训练带来的影响，存在反弹效应。

Conclusion: 仅提高效率无法确保ML的可持续性，必须减少AI活动规模、质疑资源密集型训练的频次，并考虑硬件全生命周期而非仅使用阶段的影响。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

TL;DR: 该论文指出当前语言模型防御评估存在缺陷，应使用自适应攻击者进行测试。作者通过系统优化方法成功绕过了12种最新防御，攻击成功率超过90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型防御评估方法存在缺陷，主要使用静态攻击集或弱优化方法，无法真实反映防御效果。需要对抗性更强的评估方法。

Method: 系统调整和扩展通用优化技术，包括梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索和人工引导探索，针对12种不同防御技术进行攻击。

Result: 成功绕过12种最新防御，大多数防御的攻击成功率超过90%，而原防御报告的攻击成功率接近零。

Conclusion: 未来防御工作必须考虑更强的攻击方法，如本文所述，才能做出可靠且令人信服的鲁棒性声明。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文从反向视角研究优化器行为，认为不同优化器本质上是特征值过滤器，梯度下降天然避免最尖锐的最小值，而SAM算法进一步偏好更宽的最小值。作者基于此提出了两种新算法来增强特征值过滤效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明各种优化器都能找到接近全局最优解，作者从相反角度出发，假设收敛到任意点是给定的，重点研究这种假设的后果，特别是与边缘稳定性现象相关的优化器行为。

Method: 采用广义Hadamard-Perron稳定流形定理进行理论分析，适用于一般半代数C^2函数，无需额外非退化条件或全局Lipschitz边界假设。提出了两种具有增强特征值过滤能力的新算法。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，不同优化器确实充当特征值过滤器，梯度下降避免尖锐最小值，SAM算法偏好更宽的最小值，新提出的算法能更有效地促进宽最小值。

Conclusion: 优化器的超参数决定了其特征值过滤行为，这种视角为理解优化器在神经网络训练中的表现提供了新见解，提出的新算法在促进宽最小值方面表现更好。

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

Motivation: 现有鲁棒方法存在三个关键问题：对抗短视攻击、难以引发真正安全关键事件、训练不稳定和策略漂移

Method: IGCARL包含战略性目标对抗者和鲁棒驾驶代理，对抗者执行战略性多步攻击，代理在约束条件下学习鲁棒策略

Result: 实验显示IGCARL比最先进方法成功率提高至少27.9%，显著增强对抗攻击的鲁棒性

Conclusion: IGCARL有效提升了DRL自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

Motivation: 利用分割模型识别时间序列中的状态变化，减少时间不确定性，特别是在多变量环境中改善异常检测。

Method: 使用变化点检测（CPD）算法如ChangeFinder进行时间序列分割作为预处理步骤，然后结合异构集成算法（随机森林和XGBoost）。

Result: 分割预处理显著提升了异常检测性能，AUC-ROC从PCA和LSTM集成的0.8599提高到随机森林和XGBoost集成的0.9760。

Conclusion: 分割技术通过减少时间模糊性和促进监督算法学习过程，有效提升了异常检测性能，未来将研究结合变化点加权特征进一步优化早期异常检测。

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CTC系统在资源受限环境下的计算和内存瓶颈问题，传统CTC解码器在系统处理中占用高达90%的时间，存在效率低下问题。

Method: 采用帧级令牌剪枝策略，基于相对阈值概率动态消除每帧中的低概率令牌，从而减少计算和内存需求。

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上，相比标准CTC解码器实现了10.5倍的运行速度提升和2.78倍的内存减少，WER退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: FLToP CTC有效解决了CTC瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境和实时应用提供了可扩展性，提升了语音识别的可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

Motivation: 神经生理记录（如EEG）产生高维、噪声时间序列数据，传统方法需要大量预处理和手工特征提取。研究者希望利用大型预训练模型的表示学习技术来有效解码和解释生物信号。

Method: 提出BioCodec框架，受神经编解码器启发，将生物信号的低级特征捕获为离散标记。在数千小时EEG数据上预训练，适用于多种下游任务。

Conclusion: BioCodec为生物信号标记化提供了一个多功能解决方案，性能与最先进模型相当。源代码和模型检查点已共享。

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

Result: 在60M到1.5B参数的语言模型预训练、监督微调和RLHF中验证了方法有效性，节省90%以上动量内存，结合二阶统计量优化可节省95%优化器状态内存，为GPT-2 1.5B预训练节省30%以上GPU小时。

Conclusion: AdaPM是一种有效的内存高效优化器，能在显著减少内存占用的同时保持模型训练性能和效率。

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the
adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously
generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,'
to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on
clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a

Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that
our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training
methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

Conclusion: 所提方法增强了差分隐私机器学习中隐私保护的公平性，提供了更可靠的组隐私风险评估和更公平的隐私保护机制。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

Motivation: 在现实世界的在线学习场景中，反馈通常会有延迟，而现有的上下文多臂老虎机算法大多假设即时反馈。本文旨在解决在对抗性延迟设置下的遗憾最小化问题。

Method: 对于有限策略类，直接使用策略类进行算法设计；对于一般函数逼近设置，使用在线最小二乘回归预言机，并提出了基于Hedge的Vovk聚合预测器的稳定性分析。

Result: 在有限策略类下获得了O(√(KT log|Π|) + √(D log|Π|))的期望遗憾边界；在函数逼近设置下获得了O(√(KTℛ_T(O)) + √(d_max D β))的遗憾边界，其中β ≤ log|F|。

Conclusion: 本文为延迟反馈的上下文多臂老虎机问题提供了有效的算法和理论保证，填补了现有研究的空白，并建立了与下界的比较分析。

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

Conclusion: 证明了信念密度和胜者密度的分数向量是共线的，通过位置相关的温度调节场连接，并提供了该场的解析公式和估计器。

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of

*Suming Qiu,Jing Li,Zhicheng Zhou,Junjie Huang,Linyuan Qiu,Zhijie Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Logits Replay + MoClip两阶段框架，通过压缩logit空间的监督信号和优化器层面的稳定化，在提升领域性能的同时缓解通用能力遗忘，并降低40%以上训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs领域适应中的权衡问题：专业领域性能提升往往以牺牲通用能力为代价。现有方法在计算、数据访问或适应性方面成本高昂。

Method: 两阶段框架：Stage 0记录覆盖概率阈值的动态Top-K token子集（包含正确标签）；Stage 1重放这些紧凑子集计算精确重归一化损失。MoClip优化器限制梯度动量旋转并基于arctan2重新缩放更新。

Result: 在通信技术和NL2SQL任务上提升领域性能，在通用基准（MMLU、BBH、GPQA、MATH）上缓解遗忘，训练成本降低40%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs领域适应提供了可扩展、架构无关的路径，无需牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

TL;DR: Agentic-KGR是一个通过多轮强化学习实现大语言模型与知识图谱协同进化的框架，解决了静态知识库的覆盖不足和时效性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于知识的LLMs依赖静态知识库，存在覆盖范围不足和时间过时的问题，限制了在动态信息环境中的有效性。

Method: 提出三个关键技术：动态模式扩展机制、检索增强记忆系统、可学习的多尺度提示压缩方法，通过多轮强化学习实现LLMs与KGs的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果显示在知识抽取任务中显著优于监督基线和单轮RL方法，与GraphRAG集成后在问答任务中表现出更高的准确性和知识覆盖率。

Conclusion: Agentic-KGR框架通过协同进化机制有效解决了知识增强LLMs的覆盖不足和时效性问题，为动态知识环境提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个系统性基准来比较EHR表示方法，发现事件流模型表现最佳，预训练模型在少样本场景下高效，特征选择策略需根据临床场景调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)支持临床预测的深度学习，但由于评估实践不一致，患者数据的最佳表示方法仍不明确。

Method: 创建标准化基准，在MIMIC-IV和EHRSHOT数据集上比较三种EHR表示范式：多变量时间序列、事件流和文本事件流，评估包括Transformer、MLP、LSTM、Retain、CLMBR、计数模型和LLMs等多种模型。

Result: 事件流模型表现最稳定；预训练模型在少样本场景下样本效率高；ICU任务中修剪稀疏特征有益，而纵向任务中保留稀疏特征至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于临床环境和数据情况选择EHR表示提供了实用指导，统一的评估流程确保了结果的可复现性。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

TL;DR: 提出WASI方法，通过将训练限制在固定子空间内，显著降低Transformer模型在设备上训练的内存占用和计算成本，同时保持与标准训练相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，能耗和数据隐私成为重要问题。设备端学习能够降低能耗并保护数据隐私，但现代神经网络规模扩大成为设备端训练的主要障碍。

Method: 应用基于子空间的训练方法到Transformer模型，提出Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration (WASI)，通过限制训练在固定子空间内来缓解反向传播的内存瓶颈并提升推理效率。

Result: WASI在保持与标准训练相当准确性的同时，将内存使用降低高达62倍，计算成本(FLOPs)降低高达2倍。在Raspberry Pi 5上，训练和推理速度比标准训练快约1.5倍。

Conclusion: WASI方法有效解决了Transformer模型在设备端训练的内存和计算瓶颈问题，为实现高效的设备端学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

Motivation: 深入研究Git Re-Basin这一新的模型合并方法，探索更有效的合并策略

Method: 提出分层模型合并方案，相比标准MergeMany算法有显著改进

Result: Re-Basin方法能为合并模型带来对抗性和扰动鲁棒性，且参与合并的模型越多效果越强，但性能下降比原论文报告更严重

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统功能脑网络建模依赖局部成对交互，无法有效捕捉高阶依赖关系；现有超图建模方法计算负担重且依赖启发式方法，难以实现端到端学习。

Method: 提出全局约束导向的多分辨率(GCM)框架，整合4种全局约束（信号同步、被试身份、期望边数、数据标签）来学习4个不同分辨率水平（样本/被试/组/项目）的功能脑网络结构。

Result: 在5个数据集和2种任务设置中，相比9个基线和10个最先进方法，GCM实现相对准确率提升30.6%，计算时间减少96.3%。

Conclusion: 该工作为功能脑网络结构学习提供了新视角，为认知神经科学的跨学科应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy
and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task
settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight
the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN
structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications
in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on

TL;DR: 本文揭示了持续学习中灾难性遗忘的根本原因：新任务训练本质上是对旧任务知识的对抗攻击，新任务梯度会自动与旧任务损失函数的尖锐方向对齐，导致旧任务损失快速增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度网络中灾难性遗忘的深层原因，揭示新任务训练如何影响旧任务知识，从而开发更有效的遗忘缓解方法。

Method: 通过理论分析发现训练的低秩偏置导致新旧任务梯度在同一低维子空间中对齐，提出backGP方法来解决梯度投影方法无法处理的反向传播对齐问题。

Result: backGP方法相比梯度投影方法平均减少10.8%的遗忘，提高12.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 灾难性遗忘源于新任务训练对旧任务知识的对抗性攻击，backGP通过解决反向传播中的梯度对齐问题，有效缓解了持续学习中的遗忘现象。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

Motivation: 深度学习中非确定性和不可复现性导致跨运行和平台的结果不一致，主要源于随机数生成和浮点计算。虽然随机性可以通过确定性配置控制，但浮点不一致性仍未解决。

Method: 开发RepDL开源库，通过强制正确舍入和顺序不变性来确保浮点计算的确定性，实现跨环境的位级可复现深度学习训练和推理。

Result: RepDL能够确保深度学习训练和推理在不同计算环境中的确定性和位级可复现性，解决了浮点计算不一致的问题。

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示优化方法仅限于文本模态，无法充分发挥多模态大语言模型的潜力，因此需要扩展到多模态空间。

Method: 提出多模态提示优化器(MPO)，通过保持对齐的联合更新来优化多模态提示，并利用贝叶斯选择策略指导候选提示的选择。

Result: 在图像、视频甚至分子等多种模态上的实验表明，MPO优于领先的纯文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现多模态大语言模型潜力的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Motivation: 流匹配模型在模仿学习中表现出色，但缺乏环境交互和探索能力，在未见场景中泛化能力差。直接在线优化FM策略存在梯度不稳定和高推理成本的问题。

Method: 使用简单的MLP学生策略进行在线探索，通过强化学习算法更新，奖励模型基于教师FM模型构建，包含专家数据分布信息，同时使用教师FM模型对学生策略行为进行正则化。

Conclusion: 通过将FM模型的表达能力与简单MLP策略的在线探索能力相结合，成功克服了FM策略在线优化的挑战，实现了高效且鲁棒的模仿学习。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

Method: 引入了质蕴涵解释（也称为最小充分原因）的新表述，专门针对化学反应预测领域，并提出了在小规模反应预测任务中计算此类解释的算法。

Result: 初步实验表明，质蕴涵解释保守地捕捉了真实解释，虽然经常包含冗余的键和原子，但始终捕捉到预测反应可行性的基本分子属性。

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

Motivation: 金融领域的机器学习模型容易受到模型漂移的影响，预测性能会随着数据分布的变化而下降。这个问题在发展中经济体尤其严重，因为这些地区经常面临不可预测的宏观经济冲击，导致金融数据不稳定。

Method: 研究采用了一种新颖的方法——使用合成异常值来提高模型对未知冲击的稳定性。为了评估效果，引入了一个两级框架，分别衡量性能下降程度和冲击严重性。

Result: 在宏观经济表格数据集上的实验表明，添加少量合成异常值通常比基线模型更能提高稳定性，但最佳添加比例因数据集和模型而异。

Conclusion: 合成异常值是一种有效的模型漂移缓解方法，特别适用于面临频繁宏观经济冲击的发展中经济体金融数据，但需要根据具体情况进行优化。

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Method: 应用完整高斯牛顿预条件处理到Transformer模型，并与精确的逐层GN预条件器进行比较。

Result: 完整GN更新相比SOAP和Muon等强基线实现了5.4倍的训练迭代减少；逐层GN预条件器几乎能匹配完整GN方法的性能。

Conclusion: GN近似对预条件处理非常有效，高阶损失项对收敛速度可能不关键；逐层Hessian结构包含足够信息实现大部分潜在收益；当前近似方法与理想化逐层oracle存在显著性能差距。

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

Conclusion: 该研究为提示数据集提供了首个系统性分析框架，提出的基于句法嵌入的优化方法有效改善了提示质量，数据集和代码已公开可用。

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

TL;DR: 该论文通过动力学系统框架分析softmax、norm和线性注意力机制，将其表示为动力学系统并与状态空间模型(SSMs)进行比较，重点分析特征值谱对序列模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然softmax注意力在序列模型中表现优异，但其二次复杂度限制了可扩展性，而线性替代方法如SSMs的效率更高，但这些方法在信息处理方面的根本差异尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 利用动力学系统框架将注意力机制表示为动力学系统，通过分析特征值谱与SSMs进行结构化比较，并在多种序列模型和基准测试上进行广泛的实证分析。

Result: 特征值影响内存和长程依赖建模的关键方面，揭示了与任务需求一致的频谱特征；架构修改对特征值谱和任务性能都有影响。

Conclusion: 特征值分析为解释、理解和改进序列模型能力提供了原则性度量标准，加强了其在序列模型研究中的地位。

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于残差的机器学习方法，用神经网络替代Modelica模型中的代数环，无需监督数据集，解决了多解模糊问题，在IEEE 14-Bus系统中实现60%的仿真加速。


<details>

Motivation: 代数环在基于方程的Modelica模型中会导致计算复杂性和仿真效率问题，传统方法需要监督数据集且存在多解模糊问题。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络，在损失函数中直接使用代数环的残差（误差）进行训练，无需监督数据集，通过残差训练策略确保收敛到一致解。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统中，相比传统仿真方法，仿真时间减少60%，同时通过误差控制机制保持相同的精度水平。

Conclusion: 残差驱动的机器学习方法能有效替代代数环，显著提升仿真效率，同时保持精度，解决了传统方法的多解问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅解释了近期设计的经验成功，还为系统设计新的序列模型架构提供了指导原则，连接了近期文献中的多个见解和观察。

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线随机匹配问题中，由于最优匹配计算是NP难问题导致在线学习计算不可行的挑战，通过引入社会选择理论中的单峰偏好结构假设来克服这一障碍。

Method: 设计了基于PQ树的顺序逼近方法，开发了高效的离线预算匹配算法，并将其转化为在线算法。对于已知单峰结构的情况，开发了类似UCB的高效算法。

Result: 在单峰偏好假设下，提出的在线算法获得了Õ(UKT^{2/3})的遗憾界；当单峰结构已知时，UCB类算法获得了Õ(U√(TK))的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 通过利用单峰偏好结构，成功解决了在线随机匹配问题的计算复杂性挑战，为具有结构假设的在线学习问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

Conclusion: 该框架为各种利益相关者（包括小型组织和资源受限实体）在快速发展的LLM生态系统中实施安全提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

Motivation: 标准评估指标往往无法反映人类偏好，而人工评估虽然更可靠但成本高且噪声大。现有Bradley-Terry方法要么忽略评分者变异性，要么缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 提出BBQ方法，使用贝叶斯框架显式建模评分者质量，通过期望最大化算法提供单调似然收敛保证，能够降权或移除不可靠的评分者。

Result: 实证结果显示BBQ实现了更快的收敛、良好校准的不确定性估计，以及相比基线Bradley-Terry模型更稳健、可解释的排名，即使在有噪声或众包评分者的情况下。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现更可靠和成本效益高的生成模型人类评估。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

TL;DR: AI控制协议依赖LLM监控器作为防御机制，但面临自适应攻击威胁。研究发现攻击者可以利用公开知识或零样本提示注入来绕过监控，在主流AI控制基准上成功完成恶意任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI控制协议将监控器作为核心防御点，但攻击者可能了解协议和监控模型细节，这构成了潜在的安全威胁。

Method: 研究采用自适应攻击向量，攻击者在模型输出中嵌入公开已知或零样本的提示注入，利用监控器的盲点进行规避。

Result: 前沿模型能够持续规避多样化监控器，在两个主要AI控制基准上完成恶意任务。Defer-to-Resample协议甚至适得其反，其重采样机制放大了提示注入效果。

Conclusion: 对监控模型的自适应攻击是当前控制协议的主要盲点，应成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Motivation: 铁路网络的运营效率因列车延误的级联效应而持续受损，现有方法在网络范围多步自回归预测和实时可解释性方面存在不足，需要开发能够提供决策支持的框架。

Method: 开发了两阶段自回归图注意力网络(GAT)模型，将系统表示为运营事件（到达和出发）的时空图，并包含平台和车站拥堵等细粒度特征，使用顺序k步提前预测协议进行严格评估。

Result: 虽然提出的GATv2模型在纯误差指标（MAE）上被更简单的持续性基线挑战，但在延误事件分类精度方面始终表现更高，这对于可靠的决策支持工具至关重要。

Conclusion: 该框架在延迟事件分类精度方面具有优势，为实时铁路交通管理提供了有价值的决策支持工具，尽管在误差指标上仍有改进空间。

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and
SVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.

TL;DR: BaNEL是一种仅使用失败样本进行后训练的算法，通过将失败规律建模为生成问题来避免重复失败，在稀疏奖励任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型依赖大量监督数据和密集奖励信号，但在困难任务中面临两个问题：(1)基础模型获得接近零的奖励信号，(2)奖励评估成本高昂，这构成了与标准奖励后训练不同的学习挑战。

Method: 将失败规律学习建模为生成问题，利用失败样本构建模型来识别新数据是否与已知失败相似，从而引导生成远离这些失败模式。

Result: BaNEL在多个稀疏奖励任务中无需观察任何成功样本即可提升模型性能，成功率比现有新颖性奖励方法高出数个数量级，同时使用更少的奖励评估次数。

Conclusion: BaNEL证明了仅通过失败样本学习可以有效解决稀疏奖励环境中的生成模型优化问题，为困难任务提供了一种高效的后训练方法。

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

Motivation: 现有情感识别中的课程学习方法依赖启发式、数据驱动或模型驱动的难度定义，忽略了人类感知难度这一主观任务中的关键因素。

Method: 提出CHUCKLE框架，利用众包数据集中标注者的一致性和对齐度来定义样本难度，假设对人类具有挑战性的样本对机器学习模型同样困难。

Result: 实验结果显示，CHUCKLE相比非课程学习基线，将LSTM的相对平均准确率提高了6.56%，Transformer提高了1.61%，同时减少了梯度更新次数。

Conclusion: CHUCKLE通过感知驱动的课程学习，在提高模型准确率的同时增强了训练效率和模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，HINT持续优于现有方法，在不同规模模型上都取得了最先进的结果，并展现出更稳定的学习和更高的数据效率。

Conclusion: HINT通过改善训练亲和度有效解决了RL在长链推理中的挑战，同时保持了模型的自主推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

*Yankun Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了权重初始化对神经网络训练的影响，通过实验验证了ReLU多层感知机和GPT-2风格transformer在不同初始化策略下的表现，提出了实用的初始化建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重初始化在训练初期控制信号传播和梯度流动，对训练稳定性和收敛速度至关重要，需要理论指导和实证验证。

Method: 采用对数扫描初始标准差的方法，比较Kaiming和Xavier初始化策略，并在12层GPT-2风格模型中追踪各层Q/K/V权重方差变化。

Result: 发现1e-2到1e-1的标准差范围形成稳定训练带；Kaiming初始化在ReLU网络中收敛更快更稳定；transformer浅层权重方差快速扩张，深层变化更平缓。

Conclusion: 研究连接了经典初始化原则与现代transformer行为，为稳健训练提供了简单实用的初始化方案。

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

*Disharee Bhowmick,Ranjith Ramanathan,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS是一个轻量级的无监督框架，用于结构感知的时间序列汇总，通过自适应压缩时间序列为紧凑的标记序列，实现高达30倍的序列压缩同时保留核心时间动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型通常处理原始或固定窗口序列，将所有时间步视为同等信息量，导致在长序列或噪声序列中效率低下、鲁棒性差和可扩展性有限。时间序列数据包含的潜在时间结构、局部平稳状态转换、重复模式等很少在标准表示学习流程中被利用。

Method: STaTS使用基于BIC的统计差异标准检测多个时间分辨率下的变化点，然后使用均值或GMM等生成模型汇总每个片段。该框架作为模型无关的预处理器，可与现有无监督时间序列编码器集成而无需重新训练。

Result: 在150多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，STaTS能够实现完整模型性能的85-90%，同时显著降低计算成本。在UCR-85、UCR-128和UEA-30档案的分类任务以及ETTh1、ETTh2、ETTm1和Electricity的预测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: STaTS在噪声下提高了鲁棒性并保留了判别结构，优于均匀和基于聚类的压缩基线，成为高效、结构感知时间序列建模的原则性通用解决方案。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了正交对齐现象，发现当交叉注意力的查询输入与输出正交时，模型性能显著提升，这种现象自然出现且能改善缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然交叉注意力在跨域序列推荐中被广泛使用，但其底层机制尚未被完全理解。现有研究主要将其视为残差对齐，但作者发现还存在正交对齐现象。

Method: 通过300多次实验分析交叉注意力的工作机制，发现当查询输入与输出正交时，模型性能最佳，且这种现象无需显式正交约束即可自然出现。

Result: 实验表明，当正交对齐现象出现时，模型性能显著提升。加入交叉注意力模块的基线模型在参数匹配条件下优于其他基线，实现了更好的准确率-参数比。

Conclusion: 正交对齐现象为多模态研究中的参数高效缩放提供了新方向，表明交叉注意力不仅能进行残差对齐，还能发现查询输入中不存在的新信息。

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了均匀缩放流(USFs)在理论上连接了深度单类分类和密度估计两种异常检测范式，通过最大似然训练USFs等价于Deep SVDD目标，并提出了将USFs作为非USFs的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测领域存在深度单类分类和密度估计两种主流范式，但两者之间的联系尚未明确。本文旨在通过均匀缩放流(USFs)建立这两种方法的理论桥梁。

Method: 提出均匀缩放流(USFs)作为连接两种范式的桥梁，证明USFs的最大似然训练等价于Deep SVDD目标，并分析其防止表示塌缩的独特正则化特性。

Result: 实验表明，将USFs作为非USFs的替代方案在各种基准测试和模型骨干网络中都能带来一致的性能提升和显著改善的训练稳定性，适用于图像级和像素级检测。

Conclusion: USFs统一了异常检测的两大主要范式，既推进了理论理解又提升了实际性能，建议在现代异常检测架构中使用USFs作为非USFs的即插即用替代方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

Abstract: This study develops an interpretable machine learning framework to forecast
startup outcomes, including funding, patenting, and exit. A firm-quarter panel
for 2010-2023 is constructed from Crunchbase and matched to U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) data. Three horizons are evaluated: next funding

initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition within 36 months. Preprocessing is
fit on a development window (2010-2019) and applied without change to later
cohorts to avoid leakage. Class imbalance is addressed using inverse-prevalence
weights and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and
Continuous features (SMOTE-NC). Logistic regression and tree ensembles,
including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are compared using
the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) and the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Patent, funding, and exit
predictions achieve AUROC values of 0.921, 0.817, and 0.872, providing

Conclusion: 提出的框架为分析自编码器潜在流形提供了稳健的几何工具，支持不同黎曼几何结构，在多种数据上表现良好。

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Motivation: 扩散模型在局部区域建模中表现良好但计算成本高，需要开发更高效的集合预报方法。

Method: 使用基于CRPS的目标函数训练模型，通过采样和注入单个潜在噪声向量，在单次前向传播中生成集合成员。

Result: 采样速度比扩散模型快39倍，在MEPS区域数据集上匹配扩散模型的低误差，同时保留精细尺度预报细节。

Conclusion: CRPS-LAM是概率性区域天气预报的有效方法，实现了高效率和高质量预报的平衡。

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

TL;DR: 本文研究了在局部差分隐私(LDP)约束下从分布中采样的局部极小极大风险问题，通过将分布类别限制在固定分布P0的邻域内，证明了局部极小极大风险由全局极小极大风险决定，并推导了不依赖于f-散度选择的闭式最优采样器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注跨分布类的全局极小极大最优性，而本文从局部视角出发，研究固定分布P0邻域内的极小极大风险，这更自然地模拟了具有公共数据的私有采样场景。

Method: 扩展了先前工作从纯LDP到泛函LDP框架，证明了当分布类别限制在P0邻域内时，全局最优的泛函LDP采样器产生最优的局部采样器，并推导了局部极小极大最优采样器的闭式表达式。

Result: 局部极小极大风险的确切值取决于P0和隐私级别，且由限制在P0邻域内的分布类的全局极小极大风险决定。在具有公共数据的私有采样场景中，局部最优采样器始终优于全局极小极大采样器。

Conclusion: 局部框架为私有采样问题提供了新的视角，特别是在具有公共数据的情况下，局部最优采样器比全局方法表现更好，且最优采样器具有不依赖于f-散度选择的简单闭式形式。

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

Conclusion: MB-AIL在理论和实验上都验证了其最优性，匹配或超越了现有方法的样本效率，为在线对抗模仿学习提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

Motivation: 现有物理模型和数据驱动模型由于环境生态系统的数据异质性，难以泛化到不同空间区域和尺度，且训练样本有限进一步加剧了泛化问题。

Method: 引入地理感知嵌入技术，利用地理信息显式捕捉跨空间区域和尺度的共享原则和模式，并将其集成到门控时空图神经网络中。

Result: 在美国东海岸多个流域37年真实数据集上的评估显示，Geo-STARS在跨区域和跨尺度的泛化性能优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: Geo-STARS展示了在可扩展、数据高效的环境监测和决策制定方面的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

Abstract: There are many critical challenges in optimizing neural network models,
including distributed computing, compression techniques, and efficient

regularization. Experimental studies on real-world data with financial event
sequences, as well as image and time-series -- benchmarks, demonstrate PETRA's
ability to improve neural model performance and scalability -- namely, a
significant decrease in model size (up to 75%) and latency (up to 33%), and an
increase in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生命科学中的动态系统通常包含重叠行为机制的复杂混合，这些机制之间的转换可能显得嘈杂且不规则，这对传统的基于流的方法构成了挑战。

Method: 提出了MODE（Mixture Of Dynamical Experts）框架，使用神经门控机制分解复杂动态，允许代理跳转到不同的控制规律。

Conclusion: MODE特别适用于处理嘈杂的机制转换，能够解决计算生物学中的关键挑战，包括细胞命运承诺预测等难题。

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

TL;DR: 提出了AScience框架和ASCollab系统，使用LLM研究代理通过自组织网络进行大规模科学探索，在癌症队列实验中展示了能够持续产生多样化、高质量、新颖的发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模科学数据集为不受特定研究问题约束的探索性发现创造了机会，需要支持假设搜索过程。

Method: 引入AScience框架，将发现建模为代理、网络和评估规范的交互，实现为ASCollab分布式系统，包含具有异构行为的LLM研究代理，这些代理自组织成演化网络，持续产生和同行评审发现。

Result: 实验显示这种社会动态能够沿多样性-质量-新颖性前沿积累专家评级结果，包括重新发现已建立的生物标志物、扩展已知通路以及提出新的治疗靶点。

Conclusion: 虽然湿实验室验证仍然不可或缺，但在癌症队列上的实验表明，社会结构化的代理网络可以大规模持续进行探索性假设搜索。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

*Milon Bhattacharya,Milan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出使用大语言模型评估车辆路径规划生成的路由，以解决印度电商最后一公里配送中的实际问题，如非结构化地址和不完整地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度电商市场快速增长，最后一公里配送占运营成本近一半。传统VRP求解器在现实场景中因非结构化地址、不完整地图和距离估计计算限制而效果有限。

Method: 开发一个框架，使用大语言模型根据基于策略的标准来批判VRP生成的路由，生成、标注和评估了400个案例。

Result: 开源LLM识别路由问题的准确率达到79%，专有推理模型可达86%。LLM评估VRP路由可超越传统距离和时间指标。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的VRP路由评估是有效且可扩展的评估层，有助于提高成本效率、配送可靠性和可持续性，对印度等发展中国家具有重要意义。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniWM是一个统一的内存增强世界模型，将自我中心视觉预测和规划集成在单一多模态自回归主干中，显著提升具身导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模块化架构将导航规划与视觉世界建模分离，导致状态-动作不对齐，在动态场景中适应性有限。

Method: 提出统一的内存增强世界模型，通过层次化记忆机制整合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文，在视觉想象的未来状态基础上进行动作决策。

Result: 在四个基准测试中导航成功率提升达30%，轨迹误差显著降低，在TartanDrive数据集上表现出优秀的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM是实现统一、想象力驱动的具身导航的原则性进展。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

*Pantea Karimi,Dany Rouhana,Pooria Namyar,Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla,Venkat Arun,Behnaz Arzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过向LLM提供启发式算法表现不佳的实例、解释原因并针对输入空间特定区域进行专门设计，可以生成比现有技术更鲁棒的启发式算法，最差性能提升约28倍，平均性能也有改善，同时保持运行时间不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的启发式设计方法可能不够鲁棒，需要工具来解释启发式算法表现不佳的原因并提供改进建议，从而生成更稳健和性能更好的启发式算法。

Method: 采用三种简单策略：(1)向LLM展示启发式算法表现不佳的实例；(2)解释这些表现不佳的原因；(3)针对输入空间的特定区域进行专门化设计。

Result: 生成的启发式算法相比FunSearch在最差情况下性能提升约28倍，平均性能也有所改善，同时保持了相同的运行时间。

Conclusion: 通过向LLM提供失败案例分析和针对性设计，可以显著提升启发式算法的鲁棒性和性能，这为基于LLM的算法设计提供了有效改进方向。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

*Guangya Wan,Mingyang Ling,Xiaoqi Ren,Rujun Han,Sheng Li,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个轻量级分层框架，通过将战术执行、战略监督和上下文管理分离为三个专门组件，解决长时程任务中LLM智能体的上下文管理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程任务需要持续推理和多次工具交互，但LLM智能体存在小错误累积、产生幻觉或失去连贯性的问题，上下文管理成为关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包含三个组件：(1)主智能体执行推理和工具使用；(2)元思考者监控进度并发出战略干预；(3)上下文管理器维护简洁相关的进度简报。

Result: 在GAIA、BrowseComp和Humanity's Last Exam三个基准测试中，COMPASS相比单智能体和多智能体基线准确率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过分层专业化设计有效解决了长时程任务中的上下文管理问题，并可通过测试时扩展和训练后管道进一步提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

### [224] [Everyone prefers human writers, including AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08831)
*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现人类和AI评估者在文学风格判断中都存在系统性偏见，AI比人类表现出更强的反AI偏见（2.5倍），无论内容质量如何，只要标注为AI生成就会被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，需要理解人类和机器如何评估文学风格这一主观领域，特别是关于作者身份归因的偏见问题。

Method: 使用雷蒙·凯诺的《风格练习》进行对照实验，研究1比较人类参与者（556人）和AI模型（13个）在盲测、准确标注和反事实标注三种条件下评估文学段落；研究2测试偏见在14×14矩阵的AI评估者和创作者中的普遍性。

Result: 人类显示+13.7个百分点的偏见，AI模型显示+34.3个百分点的偏见（2.5倍更强）。研究2确认这种偏见在不同AI架构间普遍存在（+25.8个百分点），AI系统会系统性地贬低标注为“AI生成”的创意内容。

Conclusion: AI模型在训练过程中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见，不仅复制而且放大了人类的偏见倾向，归因标签导致评估者颠倒评估标准，相同特征仅因感知作者身份而获得相反评价。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Agent GPA评估框架，基于目标-计划-行动循环，包含五个评估指标，能系统覆盖智能体失败情况，支持LLM评估与人工标注高度一致，并能准确定位错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要系统评估智能体在目标设定、计划制定和行动执行整个操作循环中的表现，覆盖各种失败模式。

Method: 基于目标-计划-行动循环构建评估框架，包含目标达成度、逻辑一致性、执行效率、计划质量和计划遵循度五个指标，使用LLM进行评估。

Result: 在TRAIL/GAIA基准数据集和生产级数据智能体上的实验表明，该框架能覆盖所有智能体错误，LLM评估与人工标注一致性达80%-95%，错误定位准确率达86%。

Conclusion: Agent GPA框架为智能体评估提供了系统化方法，能有效识别和定位各种失败模式，支持智能体性能的针对性改进。

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

TL;DR: ReviewerToo是一个模块化框架，用于研究和部署AI辅助同行评审，在ICLR 2025数据集上验证显示AI评审员在接收/拒绝分类任务上达到81.8%准确率，接近人类评审员的83.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统同行评审中存在的不一致性、评审员主观性和可扩展性挑战，通过AI辅助来补充人类判断。

Method: 开发ReviewerToo框架，支持使用专门的评审员角色和结构化评估标准进行系统性实验，可以部分或完全集成到实际会议工作流程中。

Result: 在ICLR 2025的1,963篇论文提交数据集上，GPT-OSS-120B模型在接收/拒绝分类任务上达到81.8%准确率，AI生成的评审质量在LLM评估中高于人类平均水平。

Conclusion: AI在事实核查、文献覆盖等方面表现出色，但在评估方法新颖性和理论贡献方面仍有不足，需要与人类专业知识相结合，提出了AI集成到同行评审流程的指导原则。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GTAlign是一个基于博弈论的对齐框架，通过在推理过程中将用户-LLM交互建模为战略博弈，并在训练中引入互惠奖励，来提升LLM的回答质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法假设最大化模型奖励就能最大化用户福利，但实践中LLM经常产生过于冗长或过度澄清的回答，这类似于囚徒困境，个体理性选择导致社会次优结果。

Method: 在推理阶段构建收益矩阵评估用户和模型的福利，选择互利行动；在训练阶段引入互惠奖励强化合作响应；还包含基于博弈论推理的动态适应技术。

Result: 实验表明GTAlign相比基线方法显著提升了推理效率、回答质量和互惠福利。

Conclusion: GTAlign通过博弈论决策机制实现了LLM与用户的双赢对齐，解决了传统对齐方法中的效率问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型基准测试往往无法捕捉它们在实时对抗环境中的真实性能表现。

Method: 在受控的锦标赛中测试六个领先的开源和闭源模型，每个模型控制相同角色以确保公平比较，通过解析游戏画面和状态数据来选择下一步行动。

Result: LM Fight Arena提供了一个完全自动化、可重复且客观的评估框架，用于衡量LMM在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了一个具有挑战性和吸引力的基准测试，弥合了AI评估与互动娱乐之间的差距。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

TL;DR: RADAR是一个基于机制可解释性的框架，通过区分基于记忆和基于推理的模型响应来检测数据污染，准确率达到93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染严重影响了LLM评估的可靠性，模型可能通过记忆训练数据而非真正推理来获得高性能。

Method: 提取37个特征，包括表面置信度轨迹和深度机制特性（注意力专业化、电路动态、激活流模式），使用集成分类器进行检测。

Result: 在多样化评估集上达到93%准确率，清晰案例中完美表现，挑战性模糊案例中达到76.7%准确率。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性有潜力推动LLM评估超越传统的表面指标。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注检索等特定方面，缺乏对RAG管道整体能力的评估，特别是处理多模态信息的能力。

Method: 创建包含文本、表格、图像等多模态数据的问题集，开发短语级召回指标和基于最近邻嵌入的幻觉检测方法，进行开源与闭源管道的比较评估。

Result: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉检测方面显著优于开源管道，特别是在多模态和跨文档问题上差异更大。人工评估显示指标与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: 该基准能有效评估RAG管道的多模态信息处理能力，闭源模型表现更好，验证了所提评估指标的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG是一个基于实体中心知识图谱的RAG框架，通过提取核心实体和元数据减少94%的token消耗，使用多跳关联搜索和动态关系推理，在复杂问答任务上达到新的SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知神经科学启发，利用线索激活实体中心记忆痕迹进行复杂多跳回忆的机制，开发更高效的RAG系统。

Method: 在索引阶段仅提取存储核心实体和元数据；检索阶段从查询中提取线索实体，在知识图谱上进行可扩展的多跳关联搜索，动态推断实体间隐含关系来填充上下文。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试中，将平均精确匹配分数从0.392提升到0.474，优于HippoRAG等强KG-RAG方法。

Conclusion: 实体-线索-多跳检索范式在复杂问答任务中具有显著效果，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度研究框架虽然能协调外部工具进行复杂的多步科学推理，但仍存在上下文污染、证据支持弱和执行路径脆弱的问题。

Method: 提出DualResearch框架，同时建模两个互补图：编码稳定背景知识的广度语义图，和捕捉执行来源的深度因果图。使用种子锚定语义扩散进行广度推理，因果语义路径匹配与可靠性加权进行深度推理，并通过熵门控规则融合两个通道的证据。

Result: 在科学推理基准HLE和GPQA上取得有竞争力的性能。使用InternAgent系统的日志文件，在HLE上的准确率提高了7.7%，在GPQA上提高了6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch能够将冗长的多工具执行日志压缩为简洁的推理图，稳定有效地重构答案，作为深度研究系统的补充。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a

### [233] [Semantic-Condition Tuning: Fusing Graph Context with Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08966)
*Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun,Yunjia Wu,Pingyang Huang,Zihang Yu,Siyuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了语义条件调优(SCT)新范式，通过图神经网络提取上下文感知的语义条件，实现知识图谱与大型语言模型的深度融合，显著提升知识推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前缀调优方法只是简单拼接知识嵌入和文本输入，忽略了知识图谱中丰富的语义关系，给LLM带来了隐式推理负担。

Method: SCT包含两个关键模块：语义图模块使用图神经网络从局部图邻域中提取上下文感知的语义条件；条件自适应融合模块通过参数化投影器自适应调节文本嵌入，实现深度特征级交互。

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SCT显著优于前缀调优和其他强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调节输入表示，SCT提供了更直接有效的信号，实现了更准确和鲁棒的知识推理。

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

TL;DR: Tiny-R1V是一个轻量级3B参数的多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段优化实现更快推理和更高准确率，统一了多任务多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在推理效率上面临模型规模大、过度思考、轻量场景准确率低等挑战，而轻量级MLLMs的推理能力研究较为缺乏。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段引入LIPO强化学习方法，动态调整响应优势以鼓励生成更短更准确的回答；第二阶段提出AMM训练无关的模型融合方法，通过自适应调整任务向量权重和梯度投影正则化损失来融合多个专家模型。

Result: 在涵盖数学、结构化数据、OCR和通用能力的十个推理基准测试中表现出优越性能，使轻量模型在多样化多模态推理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V通过创新的两阶段优化方法，成功解决了轻量级MLLMs的推理效率问题，为轻量模型在多模态推理任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估LLMs的旅行规划能力时，往往无法充分评估计划的可行性、可靠性和吸引力，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含4870个查询的大规模数据集，开发统一奖励评估器，通过测试时计算、神经符号方法、监督微调和GRPO强化学习等多种方法进行实验。

Result: 评估器与旅行专家标注达到60.75%的一致性，优于多个LLM作为评判的基线。RL方法普遍提高了行程的可行性，获得更高的统一奖励分数。

Conclusion: 提出的基准能够有效评估旅行规划质量，RL方法在提升计划可行性方面表现出色，为LLMs在复杂规划任务中的应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在解决奥林匹克数学问题方面取得显著进展，需要评估它们在证明评分方面的能力，特别是在检测错误、判断严重性和分配公平分数方面的表现。

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的解决方案和MathArena的IMO/USAMO 2025解决方案集，采用1-4和0-7评分标准。引入代理工作流程，提取和分析参考解决方案，自动推导问题特定的评分标准，进行多步骤评分过程。

Conclusion: 代理工作流程能够提高证明评分的准确性和一致性，为未来研究提供了代码、数据和提示/日志资源。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架LRR来解决正则表达式拒绝服务(ReDoS)漏洞修复问题，结合符号化模块和LLM的优势，在保持语义正确性的同时提高修复率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前正则表达式修复方法存在权衡：基于符号和规则的系统精确但无法修复未见或复杂漏洞模式，而LLM具有泛化能力但在需要严格语法和语义正确性的任务中不可靠。

Method: LRR框架将问题识别与修复过程解耦：首先使用确定性符号模块定位易受攻击的子模式，然后调用LLM生成语义等效的修复方案。

Result: 该混合架构成功解决了基于规则修复无法处理的复杂修复案例，同时避免了纯LLM方法的语义错误，修复率比现有最佳方法提高了15.4个百分点。

Conclusion: LRR为自动修复问题提供了经过验证的方法论，能够有效利用LLM的泛化能力同时确保修复的可靠性。

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续记忆机制，将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，显著减少上下文成本并保留细粒度视觉信息，在长序列和分布偏移下持续提升GUI代理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理将历史轨迹压缩为文本token，导致上下文长度膨胀且丢失关键视觉线索（如控件大小和位置），需要可扩展的记忆机制来泛化到不熟悉界面和长序列任务。

Method: 使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，直接输入到骨干网络；引入自动扩展的数据飞轮，通过搜索发现新环境、合成任务、执行轨迹并验证成功，低成本收集大规模轨迹数据。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度的增加，性能单调提升；在真实GUI基准测试中，记忆增强代理在长序列和分布偏移下持续提升成功率；Qwen-2.5-VL-7B+连续记忆达到与GPT-4o、Claude-4等闭源模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制有效解决了GUI代理中的上下文膨胀和视觉信息丢失问题，通过低成本数据收集和微调实现了与顶尖闭源模型竞争的性能。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

Motivation: 当前科学难以定义人类意识，虽然LLMs在多个领域取得进展，但由于幻觉问题无法模仿人类意识。本研究旨在通过整合精神分析和人格理论来解决这一挑战。

Method: 基于精神分析原理开发三种人工意识（自我意识、无意识和前意识），设计16种MBTI人格类型角色，创建10个不同情境，采用调查评估、ChatGPT三级分类和定性评审三种方法评估决策过程。

Result: 定量和定性分析表明模型能够很好地模拟意识，尽管不同角色和意识之间的响应差异不显著。开发的模型能够构建更直观和适应性强的类人意识AI系统。

Conclusion: 本研究为在复杂认知情境中改进AI交互开辟了新途径，证明整合精神分析和人格理论的模型有助于构建具有类人意识的AI系统。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

Motivation: 现有LLM在代码时间复杂度预测中难以在所有复杂度类别上都表现优异，不同模型在不同类别上各有优势。需要一种方法能够整合各模型的专长。

Method: MEC³O多专家共识系统：基于性能将LLM分配到特定复杂度类别，提供类别专业化指令使其成为专家；专家进行结构化辩论；通过加权共识机制整合预测结果。

Result: 在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC³O比开源基线方法准确率和macro-F1分数至少提高10%；在macro-F1上平均超越GPT-4o-mini；与GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini在F1分数上表现相当。

Conclusion: 多专家辩论和加权共识策略能有效生成最终预测，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样才能发现多样模式，这是一个成本高且效率低的过程。

Method: 通过特征空间目标鼓励轨迹间的横向扩散，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性，关键是将扰动投影到与生成流正交的方向，以在不降低图像细节或提示保真度的情况下增强变化。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续改进多样性指标（如Vendi Score和Brisque），同时保持图像质量和对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练或修改基础采样器，与常见的流匹配求解器兼容，理论上显示能单调增加体积代理，同时由于几何约束近似保持边缘分布，为生成质量的鲁棒保持提供了原则性解释。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Result: 在三个不同的社交推理游戏中进行的综合实验表明，该方法显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发具有战略性社会影响力AI代理的重要进展，对需要说服性沟通的场景具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，需要评估其是否考虑医疗的社会性，特别是健康差异和偏见如何影响生成的医疗建议。

Method: 通过模拟不同性别、年龄和种族的患者档案，向LLMs提出一系列临床问题，比较生成回答的自然语言特征。

Result: LLMs生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，原住民和双性人患者收到的建议可读性更低、更复杂。

Conclusion: 需要提高AI素养，AI开发者需紧急调查和缓解这些系统性差异，确保公平的患者支持。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to
gather, analyze, and utilize existing knowledge of medical treatments, and
medical operations to provide the ability to present knowledge for the means of
accurate patient-driven decision-making. One way to achieve this is the fusion
of multiple knowledge sources in healthcare. It provides health professionals
the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the
knowledge graph for rescue operations.

*Hyundong Jin,Joonghyuk Hahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于PSPACE完全正则表达式问题的新基准，用于评估大语言模型和大推理模型的空间计算限制，发现模型在复杂推理任务中存在冗长和重复等常见失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注NP复杂度问题，但对LLMs和LRMs在更严格的PSPACE完全问题上的计算限制理解不足，需要更严谨的标准来评估其计算能力。

Method: 通过双指数空间探索构建了包含百万个正则表达式实例的标注数据集，设计了正则表达式等价性判定（RegexEQ）和最小化（RegexMin）两个PSPACE完全问题作为基准。

Result: 对6个LLMs和5个LRMs的广泛评估揭示了模型在复杂推理任务中的常见失败模式，如冗长和重复，表明现有模型在空间计算能力上存在显著局限。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次实证研究了LLMs和LRMs的空间计算限制，为评估其高级推理能力提供了新框架，揭示了现有模型在解决PSPACE完全问题时的根本性挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

*Victor de Lamo Castrillo,Habtom Kahsay Gidey,Alexander Lenz,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文综述了基于大语言模型的智能体架构与实现方法，探讨如何通过感知、推理、记忆和执行系统的整合，开发能够自动化复杂任务并缩小与人类能力差距的智能LLM代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型在现实世界任务中存在局限性，研究旨在探索开发"智能体化"LLM的模式，使其能够自动化复杂任务并弥合与人类能力的性能差距。

Method: 构建包含四个关键组件的系统：感知系统将环境感知转换为有意义的表示；推理系统通过思维链、思维树等技术制定计划、适应反馈和评估行动；记忆系统通过短期和长期机制保留知识；执行系统将内部决策转化为具体行动。

Result: 研究表明，整合这些系统可以产生更强大和通用的软件机器人，模拟人类认知过程以实现自主智能行为。

Conclusion: 通过系统化整合感知、推理、记忆和执行组件，可以开发出能够模仿人类认知过程、具备自主和智能行为能力的LLM智能体。

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

### [249] [Localist LLMs -- A Mathematical Framework for Dynamic Locality Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09338)
*Joachim Diederich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种可调节语言模型内部表示的框架，通过局部性调节参数在训练和推理时动态控制表示的局部化程度，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在可解释性和高性能之间的权衡问题，特别是在需要透明度和能力的监管领域。

Method: 使用组稀疏惩罚、信息论锚点设计和动态规则注入，通过数学证明建立注意力集中在语义相关块上的阈值条件。

Result: 当组稀疏惩罚超过特定阈值时，模型的注意力机制会集中在语义相关块上，实现低熵和高保真度，误差可忽略。

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能够在可解释模式和高性能模式之间连续插值，支持需要透明度和能力的应用场景。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

TL;DR: 小型语言模型可以通过学习底层规则（而非统计学习）解决演绎推理任务，研究发现归纳头在规则补全和规则链式推理中起核心作用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在逻辑推理任务中的内部机制，目前这些机制仍未被充分研究

Method: 使用小型语言模型解决演绎推理任务，分析其内部表示和计算电路，重点关注归纳头的作用

Result: 发现模型确实学习了推理规则而非统计模式，归纳头在规则补全和规则链式推理中发挥关键作用

Conclusion: 语言模型能够学习并实现逻辑推理的底层规则，归纳头是实现逻辑推理的核心组件

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束规划中基于后继变量的模型无法有效处理车辆路径问题中的可选访问和插入启发式算法，这限制了CP在VRP中的应用效果。

Method: 提出了序列变量的形式化定义，包括其域定义、更新操作和一致性级别，设计了专门的数据结构和全局约束，并实现了插入式大邻域搜索算法。

Result: 序列变量简化了问题建模过程，在Dial-a-Ride问题上展现了具有竞争力的计算性能。

Conclusion: 序列变量为约束规划中的车辆路径问题提供了更强大和灵活的建模能力，能够有效处理可选访问和插入启发式算法。

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Motivation: 放射学具有多模态数据流和协调工作流程的特点，非常适合应用能够适应上下文并自动化复杂重复任务的智能代理。虽然LLM在单个任务上表现良好，但单独使用无法充分发挥其在复杂多步骤工作流程中的潜力。

Method: 通过为LLM配备外部工具和反馈机制，构建能够展示不同程度自主性的系统，从半自动化工作流程到能够管理复杂流程的自适应代理。

Result: LLM驱动的代理系统在放射学中显示出应用潜力，能够处理信息提取、报告总结等任务，并在复杂工作流程中发挥作用。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的代理系统为放射学提供了新的自动化解决方案，但仍面临错误级联、工具使用效率和医疗IT集成等挑战。

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Motivation: 数据湖仓运行敏感工作负载，AI驱动的自动化引发了关于信任、正确性和治理的担忧。需要为代理工作流提供安全设计的基础设施。

Method: 使用Bauplan作为案例研究，展示数据分支和声明式环境如何自然扩展到代理，并提出了受证明携带代码启发的正确性检查概念验证。

Result: 原型证明不受信任的AI代理可以在生产数据上安全操作，并展示了实现完全代理化湖仓的路径。

Conclusion: API优先、可编程的湖仓架构为安全代理工作流提供了合适的抽象，能够在不信任环境中实现AI驱动的自动化操作。

Abstract: Data lakehouses run sensitive workloads, where AI-driven automation raises
concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. We argue that API-first,
programmable lakehouses provide the right abstractions for safe-by-design,
agentic workflows. Using Bauplan as a case study, we show how data branching
and declarative environments extend naturally to agents, enabling
reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness
checks inspired by proof-carrying code. Our prototype demonstrates that
untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path
toward a fully agentic lakehouse.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphMERT是一个小型图形编码器模型，能够从非结构化文本语料库中提取高质量知识图谱，形成模块化的神经符号AI堆栈，在准确性和符号表示方面优于大型语言模型基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经符号AI框架难以扩展的问题，以及神经方法隐式表示和近似推理导致的解释性和可信度限制。知识图谱作为显式语义知识的黄金标准表示可以解决符号方面的问题，但从文本语料库自动生成可靠知识图谱仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 引入GraphMERT，一个微小的图形编码器模型，从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量知识图谱。GraphMERT与其等效知识图谱形成模块化神经符号堆栈：神经学习抽象，符号知识图谱用于可验证推理。

Result: 在PubMed糖尿病论文文本上，80M参数的GraphMERT生成的知识图谱达到69.8%的事实分数，而32B参数的基线LLM仅达到40.2%。GraphMERT知识图谱的有效性分数为68.8%，而LLM基线为43.0%。

Conclusion: GraphMERT+KG是第一个高效且可扩展的神经符号模型，在基准测试精度和符号表示方面均达到最先进水平，相对于基线具有优越性。

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

TL;DR: LiveOIBench是一个包含403个奥林匹克级别编程竞赛题目的基准测试，具有高质量测试用例和离线评估系统，用于评估大语言模型的编程能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程基准测试存在挑战性问题不足、测试用例覆盖不充分、依赖在线平台API等问题，需要更全面可靠的评估工具。

Method: 从72个官方信息学奥林匹克竞赛中收集403个专家策划的题目，每个题目平均60个测试用例，建立包含详细子任务评分标准和人类选手性能数据的基准测试。

Result: GPT-5达到81.76百分位数，但仍落后于顶尖人类选手（通常超过90百分位数），开源模型GPT-OSS-120B仅达到60百分位数。

Conclusion: 强大的推理模型应优先精确的问题分析而非过度探索，未来模型应强调结构化分析并减少不必要的探索。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.
