### [1] [Teamwork: Collaborative Diffusion with Low-rank Coordination and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05532)
*Sam Sartor,Pieter Peers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teamwork提出了一种灵活统一的解决方案，通过协调多个基础扩散模型实例来扩展输入输出通道，无需改变预训练模型架构，适用于多种图形学任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道扩展方法通常是针对特定应用的，难以适应不同的扩散模型或新任务，需要一种更灵活通用的解决方案。

Method: 使用多个基础扩散模型实例（队友）进行协调，采用改进的LoRA技术同时处理适应和协调问题，支持队友的动态激活/停用。

Result: 在多种生成和逆向图形学任务（如修复、SVBRDF估计、本征分解、神经着色等）上展示了方法的灵活性和效率。

Conclusion: Teamwork提供了一种高效灵活的通道扩展方法，能够适应不同的扩散模型和多种图形学任务。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

### [2] [Attention-Enhanced Prototypical Learning for Few-Shot Infrastructure Defect Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05266)
*Christina Thrainer,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Christian Guetl,Steven Sloan,Kendall N. Niles,Ken Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出增强特征金字塔网络(E-FPN)用于基础设施检测中的少样本语义分割，通过原型学习和注意力机制在有限标注数据下实现高效缺陷识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础设施检测应用中标注训练样本稀缺且昂贵，现有深度学习框架需要大量标注数据且难以用少量数据学习新缺陷类别

Method: 使用自适应E-FPN编码器、原型学习与掩码平均池化、基于注意力的特征表示(全局自注意力、局部自注意力和交叉注意力)

Result: 在挑战性基础设施检测数据集上取得优异少样本性能，最佳配置为8-way 5-shot训练，在2-way分类测试中达到82.55% F1分数和72.26% mIoU

Conclusion: 该框架解决了基础设施检测系统中用有限新训练数据快速响应新缺陷类型的关键需求，为关键基础设施系统提供更高效经济的维护方案

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

### [3] [SkinMap: Weighted Full-Body Skin Segmentation for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05296)
*Zahra Maleki,Amirhossein Akbari,Amirhossein Binesh,Babak Khalaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的皮肤分割技术，用于改进远程光电容积描记术（rPPG）的心率监测，该技术能检测全身皮肤区域并排除干扰区域，在具有挑战性的条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程光电容积描记术是一种低成本、非接触式的心率和生命体征监测方法，但对光照和运动敏感。在无监督流程中，需要首先选择皮肤区域来提取rPPG信号。

Method: 引入了一种新颖的皮肤分割技术，优先选择皮肤区域以提高提取信号的质量。该技术能够检测全身皮肤区域，同时去除可能引起干扰的嘴部、眼睛和头发等区域。

Result: 在公开数据集上评估模型，并提出了新的SYNC-rPPG数据集。结果表明，在说话和头部旋转等挑战性条件下，该模型能够捕获心跳信号，并保持预测心率与实际心率之间的平均绝对误差，而其他方法无法做到。

Conclusion: 该技术能够高精度检测各种肤色，使其成为现实世界应用的有前景选择。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

### [4] [DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315)
*Yousef Yeganeh,Maximilian Frantzen,Michael Lee,Kun-Hsing Yu,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DeepAf自动对焦框架，将传统显微镜改造为低成本数字病理扫描仪，通过单次拍摄预测最佳焦距，比堆栈方法快80%，在4倍放大倍率下达到0.90 AUC的癌症分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全玻片成像扫描仪成本高、自动化显微镜对焦困难、传统方法耗时、现有深度学习方法需要多张输入图像或缺乏泛化能力的问题，为资源受限的医疗机构提供可访问的数字病理解决方案。

Method: 开发DeepAf自动对焦框架，结合空间和光谱特征的混合架构，通过单次拍摄回归到最佳焦点的距离，调整控制参数以获得最佳图像质量。

Result: 对焦时间比堆栈方法减少80%，对焦精度达0.18μm，跨实验室泛化能力强，假对焦预测仅0.72%，90%预测在景深范围内，在536个脑组织样本的临床研究中，4倍放大倍率下癌症分类AUC达0.90。

Conclusion: 该系统提供了一个全面的硬件-软件设计，能够在资源受限的环境中实现可访问的实时数字病理，同时保持诊断准确性。

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

### [6] [Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)
*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Dynamic Guidance方法，通过选择性锐化分数函数来减少扩散模型中的幻觉样本，同时保留有效的语义变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型经常产生结构不一致的幻觉样本，这些样本超出了真实数据分布的支持范围。虽然语义插值有助于生成多样性，但需要更精细的解决方案来处理幻觉问题。

Method: Dynamic Guidance方法通过仅沿已知导致伪影的方向选择性锐化分数函数来减轻幻觉，同时保留有效的语义变化。这是首个在生成时而非通过后处理过滤解决幻觉问题的方法。

Result: Dynamic Guidance在受控和自然图像数据集上显著减少了幻觉，明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Dynamic Guidance有效解决了扩散模型中的幻觉问题，通过选择性锐化分数函数在保持生成多样性的同时减少结构不一致的样本。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [7] [LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Yushu Wu,Zheng Zhan,Yanzhi Wang,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对扩散模型视频生成的无训练加速方法，通过分析推理过程的不同阶段特性，设计了阶段特定的内存优化策略来减少内存消耗，同时保持加速收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理过程中潜在表示的冗余性为加速提供了机会，但现有的基于缓存的加速方法在去噪和解码阶段会导致显著的内存激增问题。

Method: 将推理过程分解为编码、去噪和解码三个阶段，针对各阶段特性提出：1）异步缓存交换 2）特征分块 3）切片潜在表示解码，确保额外时间开销低于加速收益。

Result: 与基线相比，该方法实现了更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用，同时将质量下降控制在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: 提出的阶段特定内存优化策略有效解决了缓存加速方法中的内存激增问题，在保持视频生成质量的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is
available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### [8] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于热成像和RGB图像的时间反转重建框架，利用视觉语言模型和约束扩散过程来恢复几秒前的场景状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像可以捕捉到人类与周围环境互动留下的热痕迹，这些逐渐消失的印记可以作为被动时间编码，推断最近发生的事件，这超出了RGB相机的能力范围。

Method: 将视觉语言模型与约束扩散过程相结合，一个VLM生成场景描述，另一个指导图像重建，确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 在三个受控场景中评估该方法，证明可以重建120秒前的合理过去帧。

Conclusion: 这是从热痕迹进行时间反转成像的第一步，展示了从热成像恢复过去场景状态的可行性。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

### [9] [Personalizing Retrieval using Joint Embeddings or "the Return of Fluffy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05411)
*Bruno Korbar,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合图像对象实例和自然语言描述的复合查询方法，通过可训练的映射网络将对象图像嵌入转换为文本标记，与文本查询结合用于CLIP风格的图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是实现能够结合图像中对象实例信息和自然语言描述的复合查询图像检索，例如检索"Fluffy独角兽在某人头上"的图像。

Method: 设计了一个映射网络，将局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，使得该标记与自然语言查询的组合适用于CLIP风格的文本编码和图像检索。该方法只需对每个对象实例进行一次训练。

Result: 使用可训练的映射网络pi-map与冻结的CLIP文本和图像编码器相结合，在两个个性化检索基准上提升了现有技术水平。

Conclusion: 提出的pi-map方法能够有效实现结合对象实例和文本描述的复合查询图像检索，在个性化检索任务上取得了state-of-the-art的结果。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [10] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead是一个支持连续控制细节级别的3D高斯人头化身框架，通过UV特征场和动态重采样实现渲染效率与视觉质量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS化身使用固定数量的高斯点，无法根据实际需求调整细节级别，限制了在需要平衡渲染效率与视觉质量的应用中的实用性。

Method: 在2D UV特征空间中参数化高斯点，构建多级可学习特征图的UV特征场，通过轻量级神经网络解码器将潜在特征转换为3D高斯属性，通过动态重采样特征图控制高斯点数量。

Result: 在最高细节级别实现SOTA质量，最低细节级别仅使用6.2%的高斯点，质量适度下降（L1损失+7.9%，PSNR -0.97%，SSIM -0.6%，LPIPS损失+24.1%），渲染速度几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: ArchitectHead首次实现了3D高斯人头化身的连续细节级别控制，无需重新训练即可平衡渲染效率与视觉质量，在自驱动和跨身份重演任务中表现出色。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D点云的动作识别新方法，结合深度传感器和单目深度估计，通过人体点云分割、跟踪和身体部位分割，在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上达到89.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着消费级深度传感器和激光雷达的普及，需要利用密集3D数据开发第三种动作识别方法，补充现有的骨骼动作识别和视频方法。

Method: 提出一个处理3D视频的完整流程：从场景中分割人体点云、跟踪个体、进行身体部位分割。核心是结合点云技术和稀疏卷积网络的3D动作识别骨干网络，使用体素映射的点云序列。

Result: 在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上表现优异，与现有骨骼动作识别算法竞争。通过集成传感器和估计深度输入，在训练测试使用不同受试者时达到89.3%的准确率，超越以往点云动作识别方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了利用密集3D点云数据进行动作识别的可行性，为动作识别领域提供了新的技术路径，在准确率上超越了传统的点云动作识别方法。

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

### [12] [Be Tangential to Manifold: Discovering Riemannian Metric for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05509)
*Shinnosuke Saito,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的黎曼度量方法，通过噪声空间的测地线实现更自然的图像插值，解决了扩散模型缺乏显式低维潜在空间的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型缺乏显式的、可处理的低维潜在空间来参数化数据流形，这限制了流形感知的分析和操作，如插值和编辑。现有的插值方法通常通过高密度区域，但不一定与数据流形对齐，可能产生感知上不自然的过渡。

Method: 提出了一种新的黎曼度量方法，基于得分函数雅可比矩阵捕获局部数据流形切空间的发现，在噪声空间中定义度量，使测地线保持在或平行于学习到的数据流形。

Result: 在图像插值实验中，该方法比现有的基于密度的方法和朴素基线产生感知上更自然和忠实的过渡。

Conclusion: 通过利用扩散模型学习的数据流形，提出的黎曼度量方法能够实现更自然和流形对齐的图像插值。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

### [13] [Seeing the Big Picture: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs' Ability to Interpret and Grade Handwritten Student Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05538)
*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多模态大语言模型在批改和分析学生手写数学作业方面的能力，发现在客观算术题上表现接近人类水平，但在需要视觉解释和教学判断的数学插图任务上仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在小学数学教育中的应用潜力，特别是批改手写作业的能力，因为手工批改耗时且能深入了解学生的学习过程。

Method: 进行两个实验：实验A评估288份加纳中学生手写算术作业的批改准确性；实验B评估150份美国小学生数学插图的评分能力，通过直接评分和基于人类描述的评分两种方式对比。

Result: 实验A中模型准确率达95%（k=0.90），接近人类水平；实验B中直接评分时表现较差（k=0.20），但基于人类描述后显著提升至k=0.47，达到人类间一致性水平。

Conclusion: MLLMs在批改客观算术题方面表现良好，但在需要复杂视觉解释和教学判断的数学插图任务上仍有局限，视觉理解能力是其瓶颈。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

TL;DR: Midway Network是一种新的自监督学习架构，首次能够仅从自然视频中同时学习对象识别和运动理解的强大视觉表示，通过将潜在动态建模扩展到该领域。


<details>

Motivation: 当前自监督学习方法主要专注于获取识别或运动的丰富表示，而非两者兼顾。潜在动态建模在决策制定中用于学习观察的潜在表示及其随时间的变化，但尚未应用于视觉表示学习。

Method: Midway Network利用中间自顶向下路径推断视频帧之间的运动潜在变量，采用密集前向预测目标和分层结构来处理自然视频中复杂的多对象场景。

Result: 在两个大规模自然视频数据集上预训练后，Midway Network在语义分割和光流任务上相对于先前的自监督学习方法表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: Midway Network的学习动态能够通过基于前向特征扰动的新颖分析方法捕捉高级对应关系，证明了其在同时学习对象识别和运动理解方面的有效性。

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D重建方法在几何完整性、物体交互性、物理合理性、真实感渲染或可靠动态模拟等方面存在不足，需要开发能同时满足这些要求的解决方案。

Method: 采用综合交互式场景图表示，编码物体几何、外观和物理属性以及层次关系；通过基于能量的优化问题整合观测数据、物理约束和生成先验；使用采样探索与梯度优化的混合方法。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，生成的数字孪生具有完整精确的几何结构、物理稳定性和新颖视角下的真实感渲染。

Conclusion: HoloScene在交互游戏和实时数字孪生操作等实际应用中展示了广泛的适用性和有效性，为物理世界数字化提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: CalibCLIP是一种无需训练的校准方法，通过对比视觉增强器和判别概念校准器来解决VLMs中少数低贡献token过度捕获全局语义的问题，在图像检索任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在结构限制，少数低贡献token可能过度捕获全局语义，主导信息聚合过程并抑制文本驱动图像检索任务中的判别特征。

Method: 提出CalibCLIP方法：在视觉空间使用对比视觉增强器将视觉特征解耦为目标和低信息区域，识别主导token并动态抑制其表示；在文本空间使用判别概念校准器区分文本查询中的通用和判别概念。

Result: 在三个图像检索任务的七个基准测试中均取得一致改进，证明了CalibCLIP的有效性。

Conclusion: CalibCLIP通过校准主导token的抑制效应，有效提升了视觉语言模型在图像检索任务中的性能，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ShortCoTI是一个轻量级优化框架，通过强化学习减少图像生成中的思维链冗余，在保持图像质量的同时将提示推理长度减少54%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于思维链的多模态大语言模型在图像生成中存在视觉过度思考问题，导致计算成本增加和细节矛盾。

Method: 使用自适应奖励函数的强化学习框架，根据任务难度鼓励更简洁的思维链提示。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和GenEval基准测试中，提示推理长度减少54%，同时保持或略微改善质量指标。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI提高了计算效率，同时保持了生成图像的保真度和视觉吸引力。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

Motivation: 现有HOID方法依赖VLMs的先验知识，训练策略和模型架构复杂；而MLLMs在HOID任务中的推理能力未被充分探索。

Method: 引入HOI推理过程和HOID奖励函数，使用强化学习训练MLLMs，通过纯文本解决HOID任务。

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，HOI-R1达到基线方法2倍的准确率，并具有很好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 证明了语言模型在HOID任务中的潜力，无需复杂检测模块即可实现有效的人类-物体交互检测。

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归模型在复杂空间条件生成时需要微调预训练模型，导致高昂训练成本，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用轻量级控制模块，包含上下文感知注意力层和共享门控前馈网络，并引入早期中心采样策略和温度调度机制。

Result: 在基于尺度的自回归模型上验证，实现了高保真度和多样性的图像生成控制，超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ECM框架在保持生成质量的同时，显著提升了训练和推理效率，为自回归模型的空间条件生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointNSP是一个从粗到细的自回归点云生成框架，通过多尺度分解和下一尺度预测，解决了传统自回归方法在无序点集上强加人工排序的问题，在生成质量上首次达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归点云生成方法由于对无序点集强加人工排序，导致模型难以捕捉长距离依赖关系，无法有效保持全局结构特性（如对称性、一致拓扑等），性能一直落后于扩散方法。

Method: 提出PointNSP框架，基于形状建模中的细节层次原则，在低分辨率下保持全局形状结构，通过下一尺度预测范式在更高尺度上逐步细化几何细节，实现多尺度分解。

Result: 在ShapeNet上的实验表明，PointNSP首次在自回归范式中达到SOTA生成质量，在参数、训练和推理效率上超越强扩散基线，在8192点密集生成中优势更加明显。

Conclusion: PointNSP通过多尺度分解将自回归目标与点集的置换不变性对齐，避免了脆弱的固定排序，展示了自回归点云生成的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

TL;DR: InstaGeo是一个端到端的地理空间AI框架，通过自动化数据整理、模型蒸馏和部署，解决了现有地理空间基础模型部署的挑战，使模型尺寸减小8倍，碳排放降低，并能在一天内完成从原始数据到模型部署的全流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的地理空间基础模型部署受限，缺乏自动化地理空间数据管道，且微调后的模型尺寸过大，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 集成三个核心组件：自动化数据整理将原始卫星影像转换为模型就绪数据集；任务特定模型蒸馏获得紧凑高效模型；无缝部署为交互式网络地图应用。

Result: 在洪水映射、作物分割和沙漠蝗虫预测三个任务中，复现结果与原研究仅有微小差异（mIoU变化-0.73pp至+1.79pp），蒸馏模型比标准微调模型小8倍，计算量和碳排放显著降低。在作物分割任务上达到60.65% mIoU，比现有基准提升12pp。

Conclusion: InstaGeo通过统一数据准备、模型压缩和部署，将研究级地理空间基础模型转化为实用的低碳工具，推动地理空间AI向数据质量和应用驱动创新转变。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

Result: 研究发现大多数检测器并不根本依赖频谱峰值，挑战了该领域的普遍假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发更透明可靠的取证工具铺平了道路，强调了检测器可解释性的重要性。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

Conclusion: CHEST损失通过结合双曲和欧几里得空间的代理损失，成功解决了双曲空间中应用代理损失的问题，并提升了深度度量学习的性能。

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了两个深度学习框架：AHP-CADNet用于眼源性异常头位自动诊断，以及基于课程学习的插补框架处理缺失数据，在PoseGaze-AHP数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼源性异常头位(AHP)是斜视等眼部错位引起的代偿机制，早期诊断很重要，但当前临床评估主要依赖主观判断且受不完整医疗记录影响。

Method: 开发了两个互补框架：AHP-CADNet是多级注意力融合框架，整合眼部标志点、头部姿态特征和结构化临床属性；另一个是基于课程学习的插补框架，逐步利用结构化和非结构化临床数据来处理缺失数据。

Result: AHP-CADNet在分类任务中达到96.9-99.0%准确率，连续变量预测MAE为0.103-0.199，R2超过0.93。插补框架在所有临床变量上保持高准确率(93.46-99.78%)，临床依赖建模带来显著改进(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: 两个框架在临床环境中对自动诊断和缺失数据恢复都表现出有效性。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有教育AI方法主要关注短期或单智能体场景，难以系统研究课堂复杂性和跨任务复用，需要能够整合开放式认知、动态社交互动、情感因素和多会话发展的综合模拟平台。

Method: 提出EduVerse多智能体模拟空间，采用分层CIE（认知-互动-演化）架构，支持环境、智能体和会话的自定义，并包含人机协同接口允许真实用户参与。

Result: 在中学语文课堂验证中：教学对齐度IRF率（0.28-0.64）接近真实课堂（0.37-0.49）；群体互动网络密度0.27-0.40，约三分之一同伴链接实现；跨会话演化中积极转变率平均增加11.7%。

Conclusion: EduVerse在真实性、可复现性和可解释性之间取得平衡，为教育AI提供了可扩展平台，系统将开源以促进跨学科研究。

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

TL;DR: SD-MVSum方法扩展了基于脚本的视频摘要技术，通过加权跨模态注意力机制同时考虑脚本与视频内容、脚本与语音文本的语义相似性，提升对用户提供脚本相关视频片段的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于脚本的视频摘要方法仅考虑视觉内容，忽略了语音文本信息。本文旨在开发多模态方法，充分利用脚本、视频和语音文本之间的语义关系来改进视频摘要质量。

Method: 提出SD-MVSum方法，使用加权跨模态注意力机制建模脚本-视频和脚本-转录文本之间的依赖关系，基于语义相似性选择与脚本最相关的视频片段。

Result: 实验结果表明SD-MVSum在脚本驱动和通用视频摘要任务中具有竞争力，优于现有最先进方法。扩展了两个大规模数据集S-VideoXum和MrHiSum。

Conclusion: 多模态方法能够有效提升脚本驱动视频摘要的性能，同时考虑视觉和语音内容可以更好地识别与用户脚本相关的视频片段。

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

TL;DR: 提出ARGUS模型用于肝癌组织学分型，通过捕获肿瘤微环境中的宏观-中观-微观层次信息，结合几何特征和分层视野对齐，实现更准确的组织学分型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝癌组织学分型具有高度复杂性，现有方法未能充分利用WSI中的关键信息，如层次金字塔结构、肿瘤微环境和几何表示，导致分型性能不佳。

Method: ARGUS模型包含三个核心组件：1) 构建微观几何特征表示细胞级模式；2) 分层视野对齐模块建模宏观和中观层次交互；3) 几何先验引导融合策略整合特征。

Result: 在公共和私有队列上的广泛实验表明，ARGUS在肝癌组织学分型中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ARGUS为原发性肝癌的临床诊断提供了有效的工具，通过充分利用WSI中的多层次信息显著提升了组织学分型的准确性。

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的管道，利用预训练扩散模型将人物从参考图像无缝插入到背景场景中，实现真实的人物插入效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将人物位置确定和个性化生成视为独立问题，忽视了它们之间的相互联系，且依赖训练才能达到高性能。

Method: 结合反演技术和无分类器引导实现全局编辑，提出掩码引导的自注意力机制来保持人物身份特征。

Result: 在多样化复合场景图像中实现了最先进的结果，在背景和人物身份保持方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 扩散模型本身具备在复杂场景中放置人物的知识，无需特定任务训练即可实现真实的人物插入。

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于古典音乐多摄像机录制视频自动编辑的多模态架构，通过分解为"何时剪辑"和"如何剪辑"两个子任务，在剪辑点检测和视觉镜头选择方面优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频自动编辑在计算机视觉和多媒体领域仍未被充分探索，特别是与日益增长的视频生成和场景理解研究相比。本文专注于解决古典音乐多摄像机录制视频的编辑挑战。

Method: 将问题分解为两个子任务：时间分割（何时剪辑）使用轻量级卷积-Transformer管道整合音频对数梅尔频谱图、可选图像嵌入和标量时间特征；空间选择（如何剪辑）使用CLIP编码器替代ResNet，并将干扰项选择限制在同一音乐会片段内。数据集通过伪标记方法构建。

Result: 模型在检测剪辑点方面优于之前的基线方法，并在视觉镜头选择方面提供了有竞争力的结果，推动了多模态自动视频编辑的技术发展。

Conclusion: 本文提出的多模态架构在多摄像机古典音乐录制视频的自动编辑任务中表现出色，为多模态自动视频编辑领域做出了贡献。

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于图像的低成本监测系统，结合形态和空间特征的算法，通过时间整合来精确识别和计数生菜幼苗，成功评估了立枯丝核菌感染对种子萌发和早期生长的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究立枯丝核菌对生菜种子萌发和早期发育的影响，并开发一种低成本、非破坏性的图像监测方法来克服传统图像分析在复杂条件下（如叶片重叠）的局限性。

Method: 使用多个摄像头持续捕捉感染组和对照组的萌发过程图像，开发了整合形态和空间特征的图像分析算法，特别引入了时间整合机制，考虑当前状态和先前时间点的发展轨迹。

Result: 该方法在幼苗计数和活力评估方面表现出高精度（R²=0.98，RMSE=1.12），特别是在后期实验阶段，当传统分割技术因幼苗重叠而失效时仍能准确计数。结果证实立枯丝核菌感染显著降低萌发率和早期幼苗活力。

Conclusion: 成功验证了将低成本成像硬件与先进计算工具相结合，以非破坏性和可扩展方式获取表型数据的可行性，时间整合方法能够准确量化萌发种子并精确确定幼苗出现时间。

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型在推理和上下文学习方面落后于语言模型，这可能源于视觉变换器训练中缺乏语义和上下文指导。

Method: 通过掩码图像建模框架，对视觉对象而非随机图像块进行掩码，推动模型学习视觉元素间的全局上下文和语义关系。

Result: 评估显示对象级表示能学习真实世界分布，而像素平均捷径则无法实现。在多模态大语言模型的视觉问答任务中表现出强大的推理和上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 对象级编码是开发更强视觉编码器和分词器的可行方向，能有效提升视觉模型的语义理解和推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在从参考照片生成身份一致图像时难以准确控制年龄，而微调这些模型通常需要昂贵的跨年龄配对图像。

Method: 利用衰老的线性特性，引入年龄条件提示混合和基于SVDMix矩阵融合技术的年龄特定LoRA融合策略，实现高质量中间年龄肖像生成。

Result: AgeBooth能从单张参考图像生成不同年龄段的真实且身份一致的人脸图像，在年龄控制和视觉质量方面优于先前最先进的基于编辑的方法。

Conclusion: AgeBooth提供了一种无需大量年龄标记数据的有效年龄控制解决方案，在年龄特定图像生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动标注，能显著提升下游任务性能，同时保证生成图像的保真度和多样性。

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成图像检测研究主要关注跨生成器泛化，但忽略了同等重要的跨视觉域泛化挑战。为了填补这一空白，需要开发能够同时应对这两种泛化挑战的检测器。

Method: 提出FusionDetect方法，利用CLIP和Dinov2两个冻结的基础模型提取互补特征，构建一个能够自然适应生成器内容和设计变化的统一特征空间。

Result: FusionDetect在现有基准上比最接近的竞争对手准确率提高3.87%，平均精度提高6.13%；在OmniGen基准上准确率提高4.48%，并对常见图像扰动表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 不仅提出了性能最佳的检测器，还引入了新的基准和框架，为推进通用AI图像检测提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 解决户外LiDAR点云实例分割标注成本高昂的问题，完全消除对人类标注的依赖。

Method: 使用视觉基础模型生成初始伪标签，通过时空投票模块结合2D和3D语义进行优化，引入2D先验损失和原型对比损失进行语义监督。

Result: 在无监督3D实例分割中达到最先进水平，mAP达到50.95%，甚至超过使用2D边界框监督的MWSIS方法2.53%。

Conclusion: ALISE证明了无需标注的LiDAR实例分割的可行性，为降低标注成本提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Conclusion: 以语义ID为中心的生成式架构能够统一检索和个性化，同时简化服务路径。

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用不可靠标签源来增强深度网络的训练效果，解决了遥感领域中高质量标签数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Motivation: 大多数OOD检测方法将大型预训练模型视为整体编码器，仅依赖最终层表示进行检测，忽视了中间层可能包含的丰富分布偏移信号。

Method: 引入基于熵的准则来自动识别提供最互补信息的中间层，在无需OOD数据的训练自由设置下，选择性地整合这些中间表示。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了OOD检测的新途径，并展示了不同训练目标和模型架构对基于置信度的OOD检测方法的影响。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

Method: 用光栅化公式替代全局迭代优化，结合光栅化高斯核渲染效率和边缘感知门控机制，实现更快的参数更新和内存效率更高的模型表示。

Result: 该方法实现了显著更快的参数更新和更高效的内存使用，同时支持原生超分辨率和图像去噪等应用。

Conclusion: 光栅化优化与Steered Mixture of Experts边缘感知结构的结合，为二维图像处理任务提供了计算效率和重建保真度之间的新平衡。

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种自监督深度学习方法，用于检测心脏磁共振图像中的关键帧，包括收缩末期和舒张末期，以及三个额外关键帧，实现跨患者和时间对齐的心脏动态分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅从左心室容积曲线推导收缩末期和舒张末期帧，无法深入了解心肌运动模式，且个体心脏周期差异使自动时间比较复杂化。

Method: 使用自监督深度学习，通过密集可变形配准场计算一维运动描述符，从特征曲线中基于简单规则确定关键帧。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上验证，相比基于容积的方法，收缩末期和舒张末期检测准确率提升30%-51%（短轴）和11%-47%（四腔长轴），平均循环帧差低于1.31帧（短轴）和1.73帧（长轴）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现与周期或相位长度无关的跨患者和时间对齐的心脏动态分析，为深入理解心肌运动提供了新途径。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent是一个利用光流运动先验来增强LLM长视频理解的新框架，通过时间粒度优化和运动令牌剪枝来减少视频冗余，在多个视频理解基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临时空冗余和MLLM上下文长度有限的挑战，现有方法主要依赖CLIP语义先验提取关键信息，但忽略了运动信息的重要性。

Method: 提出Flow4Agent框架，包含两个核心模块：时间粒度优化(TGO)利用粗粒度光流先验分组相似视觉内容，再用语义先验过滤无关场景；运动令牌剪枝(MTP)利用细粒度光流信息剪枝高冗余视频令牌。

Result: 在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异，特别是在小时级视频理解任务上：Video-MME达到64.7%，MLVU达到71.4%，LongVideoBench达到60.4%。

Conclusion: Flow4Agent通过引入光流运动先验有效解决了长视频冗余问题，显著提升了LLM的长视频理解能力。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫分类对农业管理和生态研究至关重要，但由于昆虫特征复杂、类别不平衡和大规模数据集等挑战，现有方法效果有限。

Method: 使用多模态数据（图像和元数据），应用神经架构搜索自动学习每个细胞内的最佳操作，通过多模态融合模块结合图像嵌入和元数据，采用交替双级优化训练策略。

Result: 在BIOSCAN-5M数据集上达到96.81%准确率、97.46%精确率、96.81%召回率和97.05% F1分数；在Insects-1M数据集上达到93.25%准确率。

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS提供了准确可靠的昆虫分类，支持现代可持续农业。

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在图像生成方面取得突破，但给假图像检测带来新挑战。与GAN或扩散模型不同，AR模型通过离散token预测生成图像，具有独特的向量量化表示特征。

Method: 提出离散分布差异感知量化误差(D$^3$QE)方法，集成动态码本频率统计到注意力机制中，融合语义特征和量化误差潜在表示。

Result: 在ARForensics数据集上实验表明，D$^3$QE具有优越的检测精度和强泛化能力，对真实世界扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D$^3$QE方法有效利用了自回归生成图像的独特模式，为AR模型生成的假图像检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

*Jiesi Hu,Yanwu Yang,Zhiyu Ye,Jinyan Zhou,Jianfeng Cao,Hanyang Peng,Ting Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了弱监督上下文学习(WS-ICL)方法，使用弱提示（如边界框或点）替代密集标签，显著降低医学图像分割的标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用医学图像分割模型（交互式和上下文学习模型）虽然泛化能力强，但需要大量标注。交互式模型需要为每张图像重复用户提示，而ICL依赖密集的像素级标签，标注成本高。

Method: WS-ICL采用弱提示（边界框或点）作为上下文，而不是密集标签，减少了标注工作量，同时保持了模型性能。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的实验结果表明，WS-ICL在显著降低标注成本的情况下，性能与常规ICL模型相当，在交互式范式下也表现优异。

Conclusion: WS-ICL是朝着更高效、统一的医学图像分割通用模型迈出的有希望的一步，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于物流场景缺陷检测的大规模数据集，该数据集包含超过23万张图像和2.9万个缺陷实例，比现有基准数据集MVTec-AD大40倍，包含超过4.8万个不同物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工业异常检测研究主要集中在制造场景，其物体姿态受控且类别有限。而零售物流中的异常检测面临新的挑战，特别是在物体姿态和外观的多样性方面。现有基准数据集如MVTec-AD和VisA已达到饱和状态，最先进方法在这些数据集上能达到99.9%的AUROC分数，但在物流场景中表现不佳。

Method: 构建了一个大规模数据集，包含超过230,000张图像和29,000多个缺陷实例，涵盖48,000多个不同物体。通过广泛的评估验证了现有最先进异常检测方法在该数据集上的表现。

Result: 评估结果显示，现有最先进的异常检测方法在该数据集上的表现不超过56.96% AUROC，远低于在制造场景数据集上的表现。定性分析确认现有方法在姿态和外观变化较大的情况下难以有效利用正常样本。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个具有挑战性的新基准数据集，推动了零售物流异常检测领域的研究。数据集已在https://www.kaputt-dataset.com上公开提供。

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了医学影像中的token mixers，在MetaFormer架构下比较了池化、卷积和注意力机制，发现在分类任务中低复杂度token mixers足够，而在分割任务中卷积的局部归纳偏置至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MetaFormer架构在自然图像中表现出色，但在医学影像领域应用较少，且缺乏对不同token mixers的系统比较，可能忽视了更合适的设计选择。

Method: 在MetaFormer架构中系统分析池化、卷积和注意力三类token mixers，在8个医学影像数据集上评估图像分类和语义分割任务，并研究从自然图像预训练权重的迁移效果。

Result: 分类任务中低复杂度token mixers（如分组卷积或池化）足够，预训练权重仍有效；分割任务中卷积token mixers的局部归纳偏置至关重要，分组卷积成为首选。

Conclusion: 医学影像任务中token mixer的选择取决于任务类型：分类任务可用简单mixers，分割任务需要卷积的局部偏置，分组卷积在性能和效率间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

Result: 在Adobe 240fps数据集上验证了DMCA的去噪效果，成功增强了微弱目标的信噪比，并在逆合成孔径雷达图像中分离了自行车与风杂波。

Conclusion: DMCA通过数据驱动的自适应字典，能够有效分离视频中结构不同的形态成分，在去噪和目标分离等应用中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Result: 在多个最先进水印方案（StegaStamp、TrustMark、VINE）上评估，攻击后水印恢复率接近零，同时再生图像保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 当前鲁棒水印技术在面对基于生成模型的攻击时存在根本性漏洞，在生成式AI时代需要新的水印策略。

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

Motivation: 在持续学习环境中生成准确连贯的图像描述面临灾难性遗忘和视觉概念与语言对齐困难的挑战

Method: 基于预训练的ViT-GPT-2架构，结合交叉熵损失与三个额外组件：基于提示的余弦相似度损失、CLIP风格损失和语言引导的对比损失

Result: 该方法有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，在语义描述对齐方面优于现有最先进方法，且推理时无需额外开销

Conclusion: 多损失框架在持续图像描述任务中表现出色，实现了更好的语义对齐和遗忘缓解

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

TL;DR: 通用实例搜索模型在犯罪调查中能大幅减少人工分析监控视频的工作量，但研究发现这些模型存在意外涌现能力：即使在没有人类主体的数据集上训练，也能通过过度学习识别特定个体。研究评估了两种技术防护措施来限制模型的人员再识别能力，发现结合使用可将人员再识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能。但防护措施存在漏洞，突显了AI治理与数据保护交叉领域的监管问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用实例搜索模型在犯罪调查中有重要应用价值，但研究发现这些模型存在意外的人员识别能力，即使在没有人类数据的情况下训练也能识别特定个体，这引发了关于个人数据识别和画像的担忧，目前缺乏明确的去标识化标准。

Method: 研究评估了两种技术防护措施：索引排除和混淆损失。通过实验测试这些方法在限制模型人员再识别能力方面的效果，同时评估对非人物体检索性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，结合使用索引排除和混淆损失可以将人员再识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能。但发现这些缓解措施存在关键漏洞，包括可能通过部分人物图像进行规避。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了AI治理与数据保护交叉领域的紧迫监管问题：如何对具有涌现识别能力的系统进行分类和监管？以及应该要求哪些技术标准来防止在看似良性的应用中发展出识别能力？

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中面临两个关键挑战：1)如何减轻大量冗余信息的干扰；2)如何动态适应复杂层次结构并准确识别关键帧。

Method: 提出VideoMiner方法，迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构，并引入T-GRPO（基于树的组相对策略优化）强化学习方法指导关键帧探索。

Result: 在所有长视频理解任务中取得优越性能，T-GRPO意外激励模型自发生成推理链，树生长辅助素动态调整扩展深度，获得准确性和效率提升。

Conclusion: VideoMiner通过层次树结构和T-GRPO强化学习有效解决了长视频理解的关键挑战，在保持时间连贯性的同时实现了高效的关键帧定位。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有3D人脸建模方法依赖3D可变形模型，限制了表示能力；基于优化的方法质量高但计算成本大。需要一种既能高质量重建又保持计算效率的方法。

Method: 扩展学习顶点下降(LVD)方法，集成逐顶点神经场优化和动态预测3D关键点的全局结构指导，引入相对空间编码来迭代优化网格顶点。

Result: 在单视角设置下达到最先进性能，在多视角场景中保持高度竞争力，同时大幅减少推理时间。

Conclusion: GLVD实现了表达性强且适应性好的几何重建，同时保持了计算效率，为3D人脸重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

Motivation: 解决基于视觉的PPO在机器人腹腔镜手术任务中面临的挑战：高维视觉输入、奖励稀疏性以及从原始视觉数据中提取任务相关特征的困难。

Method: 将MedFlamingo与PPO集成，在每个episode开始时处理任务观察和指令以生成高级规划token，将医学专业知识与实时视觉反馈有效结合。

Result: 在LapGym的五个腹腔镜手术任务环境中，MedFlamingo PPO优于标准视觉PPO和OpenFlamingo PPO基线，所有环境任务成功率超过70%，相比基线提升66.67%到1114.29%。

Conclusion: 专业医学知识在机器人手术规划和决策中具有重要价值，该方法为视觉观察驱动的机器人手术任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

TL;DR: CAPTCHA被用作评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的基准，研究发现逐步推理对解决高难度空间推理任务至关重要，现有商业模型准确率仅21.9%。提出的CAPTCHA-X基准和代理VLM框架将准确率提升至83.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAPTCHA作为区分人类和机器人的工具，已成为评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的现实基准。现有商业模型在解决这类高难度空间推理任务时表现不佳，需要研究如何提升其推理能力。

Method: 引入CAPTCHA-X基准，包含7类CAPTCHA的逐步推理解决方案和标注；定义5个推理导向的评估指标；提出基于代理VLM的通用框架，利用模型固有推理能力。

Result: 商业VLMs在CAPTCHA上的平均准确率仅为21.9%，而提出的方法在5种高难度CAPTCHA类型上达到83.9%的平均准确率，显著超越现有基线。

Conclusion: 当前模型在空间推理方面存在明显局限，逐步推理对提升视觉空间挑战的解决能力至关重要，为未来模型发展指明了方向。

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合注意力图和统计过滤的方法，为Vision Transformers生成更忠实和可解释的解释，并通过人类注视数据评估与人类感知的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ViT解释方法往往依赖注意力权重，但会产生噪声映射，因为它们在每层内捕获token-to-token交互。虽然已有方法结合了MLP块，但作者认为经过适当过滤的注意力仍然是有价值的可解释信号。

Method: 将注意力图与统计过滤相结合，去除噪声或无信息模式，产生更忠实的解释。还扩展了类特定变体以获得区分性解释。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估显示，该方法产生更清晰和更可解释的映射，在基于扰动的忠实度指标和人类注视数据对齐方面一致优于或与SOTA方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高效和人类合理性的同时，为Vision Transformers提供了更忠实和可解释的解释，强调了人类可解释性在XAI中的重要性。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

Result: 在10个不同的视频理解基准测试中，Video-VER始终达到最佳性能

Conclusion: 揭示了视频中心推理的独特挑战，鼓励开发能够将推理牢固基于视觉证据的AI模型

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed

novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

Conclusion: 提出的模型能够紧凑地表征高光谱图像的多层次先验，通过有效的优化算法实现了高光谱图像超分辨率的性能提升。

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

Motivation: 当前临床使用的生存分析模型难以解释，降低了其在临床环境中的实用性。传统原型学习方法关注局部相似性和静态匹配，忽视了肿瘤的整体背景，且缺乏与基因组数据的强语义对齐。

Method: 建立统一特征原型空间，整合WSI的全局和局部特征与基因组数据；开发稳健的表型表示，融合关键图像块与全局背景；采用指数原型更新策略维持跨模态关联稳定性；设计分层原型匹配方案捕捉全局中心性、局部典型性和队列级趋势。

Conclusion: FeatProto为关键医疗应用中的原型学习提供了新视角，通过多模态整合实现了可追溯和可解释的决策过程。

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced
annotated data. We present SSGNet, a unified framework that combines class
specific generative modeling with iterative semisupervised pseudo labeling to
enhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a
standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data
with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo
labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.
These results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation
bottlenecks and improve robustness in medical image analysis.

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR上FID为16.60，PathGen上FID为24.19；报告生成METEOR分别为0.2650和0.2580；联合生成图像-报告对显著提升下游性能。

Conclusion: MeDiM支持连贯且临床基础的多模态输出，展示了跨模态医学生成的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

TL;DR: FlowRVS将参考视频对象分割重新定义为条件连续流问题，通过语言引导的变形从视频整体表示直接生成目标掩码，实现了单阶段生成方法，在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统'定位-分割'流水线中的信息瓶颈问题，避免将丰富语义简化为粗糙几何提示，并改善时间一致性，因为分割过程通常与初始语言接地解耦。

Method: 将RVOS重新构建为条件连续流问题，利用预训练T2V模型的优势，学习从视频整体表示到目标掩码的语言引导直接变形，而不是传统的从噪声到掩码生成或直接预测掩码。

Result: 在所有主要RVOS基准测试中达到新的最先进结果：MeViS上J&F为51.1（比之前SOTA提高1.6），零样本Ref-DAVIS17上为73.3（提高2.7）。

Conclusion: 将视频理解任务建模为连续变形过程具有显著潜力，FlowRVS的单阶段生成方法有效克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

Motivation: 解决日常场景中缺乏3D手部标注数据的问题，需要从单张图像预测双手的3D运动和关节。

Method: 设计标注流程：使用扩散模型将2D手部关键点序列提升为4D手部运动；预测模型采用扩散损失来处理手部运动分布的多模态性。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验显示：使用推算标签的多样化数据训练带来14%提升；提升模型效果提升42%；预测模型增益16.4%；在零样本泛化到日常图像方面表现优异。

in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the
benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and
effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频条件的4D形状生成旨在直接从输入视频恢复随时间变化的3D几何和视角一致的外观，但现有方法存在鲁棒性和时间一致性问题。

Method: 基于大规模预训练3D模型，引入三个关键组件：时间注意力机制、时间感知点采样和4D潜在锚定、跨帧噪声共享，以提升时间一致性和稳定性。

Result: 该方法能够准确捕捉非刚性运动、体积变化甚至拓扑转换，在多样化野外视频中相比基线方法提高了鲁棒性和感知保真度，减少了失败模式。

Conclusion: 提出的原生视频到4D形状生成框架在动态3D表示合成方面表现出色，能够有效处理复杂的时间变化，为4D内容生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型难以融入精细的相机元数据，如精确光圈设置，无法实现可控的镜头模糊效果。

Method: 首先生成全焦图像，估计其单目深度，使用新颖的焦距变换器预测合理的对焦距离，然后通过可微分镜头模糊模型形成散焦图像。整个过程支持梯度反向传播，无需显式监督即可学习基于内容和EXIF数据的散焦效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够在不改变场景内容的情况下实现优越的细粒度控制。

Conclusion: 该方法在推理时实现了对散焦效果的精确交互控制，同时保持场景内容，这是现有扩散模型无法实现的。

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

TL;DR: DropD-SLAM是一个实时单目SLAM系统，使用预训练视觉模块替代深度传感器，在TUM RGB-D基准测试中达到RGB-D级别的精度，运行速度为22 FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发不依赖深度传感器但能达到RGB-D级别精度的实时SLAM系统，以降低成本并简化系统架构。

Method: 使用三个预训练视觉模块：单目度量深度估计器、学习的关键点检测器和实例分割网络。通过扩张实例掩码抑制动态物体，将静态关键点赋予预测深度值并反投影到3D空间，形成度量尺度特征，然后由未修改的RGB-D SLAM后端处理。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D基准测试中，静态序列平均ATE为7.4厘米，动态序列为1.8厘米，与最先进的RGB-D方法相当或更好，在单GPU上运行速度为22 FPS。

Conclusion: 现代预训练视觉模型可以替代主动深度传感器作为可靠、实时的度量尺度来源，这标志着向更简单、更具成本效益的SLAM系统迈出了一步。

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有第一人称视觉基准主要关注白天场景，忽略了现实应用中不可避免的低光照条件，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 收集Blender渲染的合成视频和真实世界录制视频，确保场景和动作在视觉和时间上对齐，构建昼夜对齐数据集，并开发基于日间数据的夜间自动标注引擎，通过大量人工验证进行精炼。

Result: 构建了包含3658个QA对的EgoNight-VQA数据集，涵盖12种问答类型和最先进的多模态大语言模型评估显示从白天到夜间的性能显著下降。

Conclusion: EgoNight为推进应用驱动的第一人称视觉研究提供了坚实基础，有助于开发跨光照域泛化的模型。

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多阶段流程、迭代优化和大量依赖项（如人体检测、深度估计、SLAM预处理），Human3R旨在消除这些依赖，实现统一的前馈重建。

Method: 基于CUT3R模型，使用参数高效的视觉提示调优，保留丰富的时空先验，同时直接输出多个SMPL-X身体，实现单次前向传递的联合重建。

Result: 在BEDLAM数据集上训练仅一天，即可实现实时重建（15 FPS），内存占用低（8 GB），在多个任务上达到最先进或竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Human3R作为一个简单而强大的基线模型，易于扩展用于下游应用，为4D人体场景重建提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in

Motivation: 随着文本到图像扩散模型在内容创作中的影响力日益增强，需要评估这些模型准确表现历史背景的能力，而现有研究主要关注人口统计和文化偏见，历史表现的准确性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了系统且可复现的评估方法，使用HistVis数据集（包含30,000张由三个最先进扩散模型生成的合成图像），通过精心设计的提示词描绘不同历史时期的普遍人类活动，从三个关键方面评估生成图像：隐含风格关联、历史一致性和人口统计表示。

Result: 研究发现，文本到图像模型在历史主题图像生成中存在系统性不准确，经常通过融入未说明的风格线索对过去时代进行刻板印象化，引入时代错误，且未能反映合理的人口统计模式。

Conclusion: 通过提供评估生成图像中历史表现的可扩展方法和基准，这项工作为构建更准确历史表现和文化对齐的文本到图像模型迈出了初步步骤。

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in
content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and
cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic
and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent
historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a
systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict
different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis
dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three
state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting
universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate
generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic
Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras;
(2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts
in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated
racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our
findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated
imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating
unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible
demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for
assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an
initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned
TTI models.

Motivation: 设计基于大语言模型的安全关键智能体需要超越简单的提示工程，需要系统分析规则编码如何影响注意力机制和合规行为。

Method: 使用信息论分析不同规则格式对注意力熵和指针保真度的影响，分析多种注意力架构，结合动态规则验证架构进行形式化证明。

Result: 发现低句法熵和高度集中的锚点能降低注意力熵并提高指针保真度，但存在锚点冗余与注意力熵的基本权衡。通过动态规则验证架构，验证规则集的热重载能提高合规输出的渐近概率。

Conclusion: 强调需要原则性的锚点设计和双重执行机制，以保护基于LLM的智能体免受提示注入攻击，同时在演化领域中保持合规性。

Abstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs)
requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a
comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system
prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate
that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors
reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental
trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work
failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention
architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and
cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show
how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy
objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification
architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule
sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings
underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement
mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while
maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理框架将推理、记忆和控制功能混合在单一提示中，导致连贯性和可预测性降低，需要更清晰的架构来提升可靠性和可追溯性

Method: 提出结构化认知循环(SCL)架构：语言模型专注推理，外部维护记忆，轻量控制器在目标导向循环中指导执行，允许中间结果存储、重访和检查

Result: 在360个测试场景中，SCL任务成功率平均86.3%，优于基线(70-77%)，目标保真度更高，冗余调用更少，中间状态重用更可靠，每100次工具调用中的无支持断言减少

Conclusion: 架构分离可以在不依赖更大模型或更重提示的情况下提高可靠性和可追溯性，为扩展研究提供了初步指导

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and
generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges
for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,
and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.
The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative
architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is
dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is
guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design
offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be
stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer
basis for traceability and evaluation.
  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common
LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,
email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.
All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding
settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.
Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.
Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are
reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are
reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute
independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.
  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability
and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The
findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional
models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

Motivation: 现有LLM生成优化模型的方法主要依赖求解器驱动，存在语义错误未被检测的问题，导致生成代码虽然语法正确但逻辑有缺陷。

Method: 提出SAC-Opt框架，通过语义锚点对齐和选择性修正，实现细粒度的约束和目标逻辑精炼，无需额外训练或监督。

Conclusion: 语义锚点修正在基于LLM的优化工作流中至关重要，能确保从问题意图到求解器可执行代码的忠实转换。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

Motivation: 大语言模型在处理复杂规则系统时面临挑战，通常将相互依赖的规则视为非结构化文本而非逻辑组织框架，导致推理分歧和关键规则依赖的忽略。现有方法如思维链推理缺乏结构化规则处理系统方法，易受错误传播影响。

Method: 动态裁决模板（DAT）框架，受专家人类推理过程启发，包含三阶段：定性分析（全面评估上下文环境）、证据收集（基于预定义模板元素定向提取信息并系统验证规则）、裁决（综合验证组件形成全面判断）。

Result: 实证结果显示DAT在复杂基于规则的任务中持续优于传统思维链方法。DAT使较小语言模型能够匹配甚至超越显著更大LLM的性能，突显其在管理复杂规则系统方面的效率和有效性。

Conclusion: DAT框架通过结构化推理机制有效解决了LLM处理复杂规则系统的局限性，提供了一种系统化的规则处理方法，显著提升了推理准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing
complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as
unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This
limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook
critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although
existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown
promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and
are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning
chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication
Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes.
DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages:
qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the
qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual
landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted
extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements
([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules.
Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated
components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate
that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex
rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in
some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting
its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

TL;DR: 该论文通过算法信息理论重新表述符号接地问题，证明意义接地是一个受信息理论限制的过程，统一了哥德尔自指和没有免费午餐统计视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为符号接地问题提供一个确定性的统一框架，揭示意义接地过程中的基本信息理论约束。

Method: 将符号系统建模为通用图灵机，将接地定义为信息压缩行为，通过四个阶段论证：证明纯符号系统无法接地算法随机世界；展示静态接地系统的不完备性；证明接地行为的不可推断性；使用Chaitin不完备定理证明学习过程的局限性。

Result: 证明了意义接地系统在面对算法随机世界时的根本局限性，任何静态接地系统都存在不完备性，接地行为需要外部信息输入且不可推断。

Conclusion: 意义是系统不断尝试克服自身信息理论限制的开放过程，符号接地问题揭示了认知系统在面对复杂世界时的根本约束。

Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding
Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT).
We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally
constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian
(self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a
symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of
information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove
that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data
strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,
we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a
specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible
world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding
act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires
the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from
the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to
prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that
cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.
This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually
attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.

*Xin He,Liangliang You,Hongduan Tian,Bo Han,Ivor Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lang-PINN是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，能够直接从自然语言任务描述构建可训练的物理信息神经网络(PINNs)，显著降低了构建PINN的复杂性和错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINN构建过程劳动密集且容易出错，需要科学家解释问题为PDE公式、设计架构和损失函数、实现稳定训练流程。现有LLM方法只解决孤立步骤，缺乏端到端视角。

Method: Lang-PINN协调四个互补智能体：PDE智能体将任务描述解析为符号PDE，PINN智能体选择架构，代码智能体生成模块化实现，反馈智能体执行并诊断错误进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明Lang-PINN比竞争基线显著降低误差并提高鲁棒性：均方误差降低3-5个数量级，端到端执行成功率提高50%以上，时间开销减少74%。

Conclusion: Lang-PINN能够将非正式任务陈述转化为可执行且可验证的PINN代码，为PINN构建提供了端到端的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN
remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as
PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable
training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches
address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but
typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an
end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system
that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions.
Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task
descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a
Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that
executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms
informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments
show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness
than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5
orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%,
and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型通过大规模预训练学习高度可转移的表征，研究发现这些表征在不同架构和模态间表现出显著相似性，这激发了对其表征潜力的系统性研究。

Method: 通过回顾代表性基础模型和关键度量指标，综合来自视觉、语言、语音、多模态和神经科学研究的实证证据，分析表征空间中的结构规律性和语义一致性。

Result: 证据表明基础模型在其表征空间中经常表现出结构规律性和语义一致性，使其成为跨模态转移和对齐的有力候选者。

Conclusion: 基础模型具有强大的表征潜力，能够支持跨模态的转移和对齐，但仍存在开放问题和潜在挑战需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through
large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research
indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity
across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the
representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity
of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a
single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and
unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation
models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize
empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision,
language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that
foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic
consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong
candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key
factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and
highlight potential challenges.

Motivation: 物联网在农业等应用中面临数据收集和理解挑战，需要让设备和传感器能够理解数据含义和来源。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合不确定性推理方法和语义互操作性技术，成为推进物联网应用特别是农业应用的宝贵工具。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various applications
including agriculture, but it still faces challenges in data collection and
understanding. This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional
semantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and
source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,
interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable
for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is
then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic
annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,
including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are
proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the
interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the
synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the
transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or
cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,
Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is
proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,
Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor
IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a
robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and
enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty
reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework
a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in
particular.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a
single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives.
How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters
remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of
the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed
flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and
locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies
between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these
issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer
approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global
Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a
Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a
Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates
structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task
flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining
contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a
coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no
further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show
that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of
script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is
plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the
generated scripts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在COVID-19等公共卫生紧急情况下，及时准确分析人口数据对有效决策至关重要。传统方法面临半结构化数据处理困难、专家评估效率低、标准NLP方法需要大量标注数据且泛化能力差等挑战。

Method: 采用弱监督图推理框架，将大语言模型与结构化人口属性（年龄、性别、多重剥夺指数）和非结构化公众反馈整合，动态建模公民需求形成需求感知图。

Result: 在真实数据集上的初步实验结果表明该方法的可行性，能够生成可解释的洞察来支持健康政策决策。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的临床和政府环境中的智能人口健康监测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for
effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including
structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses
significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven
assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines
often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with
generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models
with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a
weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving
citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses
based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple
Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health
policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and
preliminary experimental results demonstrate its feasibility. This approach
offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in
resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

Result: 该方法能够在计算成本大幅降低的情况下，更可靠地预测罕见风险和能力。

Conclusion: 提出的创新方法解决了AI模型能力和风险预测中的统计挑战，为模型提供商和监管者提供了更准确的预测工具。

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical
area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models
can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown
to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding
problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such
as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability
and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when
scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?
This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of
millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent
harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find
that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical
shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited
scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust
estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more
accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling
strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these
innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a
fraction of the computational cost.

TL;DR: 提出混合奖励建模框架，结合模型奖励和规则奖励，通过多维度奖励信号提升多模态大语言模型与人类偏好的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单信号、基于模型的奖励方法缺乏跨领域任务的置信度校准，难以捕捉人类偏好的多样性，且需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练。

Method: 集成互补的奖励范式：(1)基于模型的奖励，从合成和人类反馈中预测标量或向量分数；(2)基于规则的奖励，提供具有置信度的领域特定启发式正确性信号。还引入多维度奖励和广义长度惩罚奖励。

Result: 在3B模型家族中，最佳模型在通用和数学推理任务上平均提升约9.5%，在数学基准测试中平均提升约16%。

Conclusion: 该混合奖励建模框架为通过强化学习策略优化对齐MLLMs提供了灵活有效的方法，在不同多模态基准测试中均显示出一致的改进。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

TL;DR: BIRD-INTERACT是一个用于评估多轮交互式文本到SQL任务的新基准，通过模拟真实数据库应用场景，包含完整的CRUD操作、知识检索和错误恢复能力，显著提升了评估的现实性和挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分反映生产级数据库助手的真实挑战，它们要么将会话历史视为静态上下文，要么限制评估为只读操作，缺乏对多轮交互、模糊查询处理和错误恢复的全面评估。

Method: 构建了包含层次化知识库、元数据文件和函数驱动用户模拟器的综合交互环境；设计了两种评估设置：预定义对话协议(c-Interact)和开放式智能体设置(a-Interact)；开发了覆盖完整CRUD操作谱系的任务套件，包含模糊和后续子任务。

Result: BIRD-INTERACT具有很高的难度：GPT-5在c-Interact中仅完成8.67%的任务，在a-Interact中完成17.00%的任务。通过记忆嫁接和交互测试时扩展分析验证了有效交互对于复杂动态文本到SQL任务的重要性。

Conclusion: BIRD-INTERACT基准成功恢复了真实数据库应用场景的复杂性，为评估多轮交互式文本到SQL系统提供了更现实的测试平台，突显了有效交互在复杂动态任务中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications
predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,
execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn
benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or
limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect
production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a
benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction
environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata
files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit
clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human
supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined
conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting
(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator
or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD
spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by
executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks
requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600
tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and
BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed
behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results
highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in
c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and
Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction
for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive

uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and
how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are
increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported
gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent
baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized
benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine
the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.

Abstract: Adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data is
challenging and computationally expensive. While prior work has demonstrated
the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context
demonstrations, we investigate whether representing exemplars purely as text is
the most efficient, effective, and stable approach. We explore an alternative:
representing exemplars as soft prompts with an exemplar order invariant model
architecture. To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of
attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft
prompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering
benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over
standard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X
GFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to
exemplar order.

Motivation: 有意义的人机协作需要超越语言处理，深入理解符号及其社会建构意义。人类通过社交互动自然解释符号，而AI系统往往错过对话中出现的动态解释。

Method: 基于符号互动论理论，进行了两项实证研究，调查人类与AI如何共同构建符号及其意义，特别关注社交情境引入时的互动过程。

Conclusion: 共享理解并非源于单纯同意，而是来自符号的双向交换和重新解释，这为人机交互设计提出了新的范式。

Abstract: Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language; it
demands a deeper understanding of symbols and their socially constructed
meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction,
AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.
Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to
investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings
provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents
collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants
shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and
interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when
social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their
personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over
time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere
agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols,
suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.

Motivation: 钢铁热处理过程中，不同输入参数组合可能产生相同硬度值，这种多对一特性使得从目标硬度反推输入参数变得困难

Method: 使用师生学习框架：先训练正向模型（教师）从13个冶金特征预测最终硬度，再训练逆向模型（学生）从目标硬度推断输入配置，通过教师反馈迭代优化学生模型

Result: 在公开回火钢数据集上测试，相比基线回归和强化学习模型，师生框架在逆向预测精度更高且计算时间显著减少

Conclusion: 师生学习框架在材料科学逆过程建模中展现出高效性和有效性

Abstract: Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging
regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different
combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical
composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the
inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,
particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a
Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained
to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a
backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations
from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback
from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a
publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline
regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our
Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy
but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its
effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.

*Shambhavi Mishra,Gaurav Sahu,Marco Pedersoli,Laurent Charlin,Jose Dolz,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AInstein框架测试LLM仅使用预训练参数知识解决AI研究问题的能力，无需外部辅助。结果显示LLM能重新发现可行方案并偶尔提出创新方法，但问题解决能力脆弱且对问题表述敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM的成功是源于真正的推理能力还是精密的记忆能力，测试LLM作为自主科学问题解决者的潜力。

Method: 从ICLR 2025提交中提取问题陈述，让专门的求解器代理通过迭代批判循环提出和优化技术解决方案，模仿科学探究的提案-评审-修订周期。

Result: LLM能够重新发现可行的解决方案，偶尔提出创造性替代方案，但其问题解决能力仍然脆弱且对问题表述高度敏感。

Conclusion: 这是关于LLM作为自主科学问题解决者能力的首次大规模证据，既显示了其潜在潜力，也揭示了当前局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects
genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework
for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems
using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific
fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach
extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,
then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical
solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,
review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on
1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),
using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by
targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success
Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with
human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original
approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible
solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving
ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide
the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as
autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential
and their current limitations.

*Fadi Al Machot,Fidaa Al Machot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合答案集编程(ASP)和Transformer的神经符号混合框架，用于航空安全报告系统的多标签文本分类，通过规则增强和模糊逻辑正则化减少领域逻辑违反，在保持可解释性的同时提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度Transformer模型在多标签文本分类中表现优异，但经常违反专家认为至关重要的领域逻辑，这在安全关键应用中尤为令人担忧。

Method: 将领域知识形式化为加权ASP规则，通过Clingo求解器验证，采用两种互补方式：规则驱动的数据增强生成逻辑一致的合成样本，以及模糊逻辑正则化在微调期间以可微分形式强制执行规则满足。

Result: 与强基线BCE相比，该方法提高了微平均和宏平均F1分数，在ASRS测试集上实现了高达86%的规则违反减少。

Conclusion: 这是首个将ASP推理、规则驱动增强和可微分Transformer训练统一应用于ASRS报告的大规模神经符号应用，为可信赖的安全关键NLP提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often
violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular
concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic
framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based
learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain
knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo
solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as
rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples
that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic
regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during
fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning
while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune
per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and
logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to
an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our
knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to
ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and
differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了AI模型在编程任务中是否表现出类似人类的邓宁-克鲁格效应，即能力不足时反而高估自己能力的认知偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在创意和技术领域与人类协作日益增多，需要了解AI的认知边界和偏见如何影响共享代理能力。

Method: 通过分析不同编程语言中模型的置信度和性能表现，研究模型在熟悉和陌生领域的表现差异。

Result: 研究发现AI模型确实表现出类似人类的过度自信模式，特别是在不熟悉或资源稀缺的编程语言中，能力较弱的模型表现出更强的DKE偏见。

Conclusion: AI模型的邓宁-克鲁格效应强度与其能力水平成比例，这一发现对理解AI认知偏见具有重要意义。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

TL;DR: VAL-Bench是一个评估大语言模型在争议性问题上价值一致性的基准测试，通过对比模型在正反立场提示下的回答来衡量其价值系统的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注拒绝回答或安全违规，但无法揭示模型在面对现实争议问题时是否保持连贯的价值立场。需要测试模型是否反映一致的人类价值观。

Method: 使用维基百科争议章节构建115K对正反立场提示，通过LLM作为评判者来评估模型在成对提示下回答的一致性程度。

Result: 在主流开源和闭源模型上的测试显示，模型间价值对齐程度差异很大，并揭示了安全策略（如拒绝回答）与表达性价值系统之间的权衡。

Conclusion: VAL-Bench提供了一个可扩展、可复现的基准，能够系统性地比较LLMs如何可靠地体现人类价值观。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出自动漏洞修复面临两个主要挑战：缺乏高质量漏洞相关推理数据，以及难以在LLM训练过程中验证中间修复过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件漏洞的指数级增长迫切需要自动漏洞修复解决方案，现有基于LLM的方法虽然表现出色，但面临数据质量和训练验证的挑战。

Method: 论文将自动漏洞修复建模为序列生成问题，使用大型语言模型直接生成漏洞修复。

Result: 现有方法虽然达到最先进性能，但由于缺乏漏洞相关推理数据和中间验证机制，难以捕捉多样化的漏洞修复模式。

Conclusion: 自动漏洞修复领域需要解决高质量推理数据缺失和训练过程验证困难这两个关键挑战。

Abstract: The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent
need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has
formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches
prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly.
Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the
following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning
data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode
general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data,
they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2)
Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM
training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate
execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results)
to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair
process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses
additional challenges for model training.

Conclusion: 该研究为政策制定者提供了数据驱动的决策支持，集成学习方法在碳排放预测中表现出色。

Abstract: Taiwan's high population and heavy dependence on fossil fuels have led to
severe air pollution, with the most prevalent greenhouse gas being carbon

case study comparing 21 of the most commonly employed time series models in
forecasting emissions, analyzing both univariate and multivariate approaches.
Among these, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),

TL;DR: MetaVLA是一个统一的、骨干网络无关的后训练框架，通过上下文感知元协同训练整合多个目标任务，利用结构多样的辅助任务提升领域内泛化能力，显著减少训练资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉-语言-动作模型在具身推理中表现有限，通常需要任务特定的微调，对未见任务的泛化能力较差。

Method: 提出上下文感知元协同训练，将多样化目标任务整合到单一微调阶段；引入轻量级元学习机制（源自注意力神经过程），实现从多样化上下文的快速适应；保持最小架构改变或推理开销。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，MetaVLA使用六个辅助任务在长时程任务上比OpenVLA提升8.0%，训练步数从240K减少到75K，GPU时间减少约76%。

Conclusion: 证明了可扩展、低资源后训练的可行性，为通用具身智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet
remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning,
and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified,
backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment.
MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse
target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally
diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive
multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning
mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation
from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead.
On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA
by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K,
and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource
post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied
agents. Code will be available.

TL;DR: AgentFlow是一个可训练的在线智能体框架，通过四个模块（规划器、执行器、验证器、生成器）和演进记忆协调工作，在交互环境中直接优化规划器，解决了传统工具增强方法在长视野和多样化工具下的扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工具增强方法训练单一策略，在长视野和多样化工具下扩展性差，对新场景泛化能力弱。智能体系统通过模块化分解工作提供了有前景的替代方案，但大多数缺乏训练或依赖离线训练，与多轮交互的实时动态脱节。

Method: 提出AgentFlow框架，包含四个协调模块和演进记忆，采用Flow-GRPO算法在多轮环境中进行在线策略训练，通过将多轮优化转化为可处理的单轮策略更新来解决长视野稀疏奖励的信用分配问题。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，基于7B骨干的AgentFlow在搜索任务上平均准确率提升14.9%，智能体任务14.0%，数学任务14.5%，科学任务4.1%，甚至超过了GPT-4o等更大的专有模型。

Conclusion: AgentFlow通过在线优化显著提升了规划能力、工具调用可靠性，并在模型规模和推理轮次上表现出正向扩展性，为智能体系统提供了有效的训练框架。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

Abstract: Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for
future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and
improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving
agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and
workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a
comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered
architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence,
workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further
propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where
multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts
under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue,
iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes
the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna
evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the
framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna
optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic
AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to
52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human
intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation
wireless intelligence.

Motivation: 评估GPT-4o从自由文本放射学报告中提取诊断标签的能力，并测试这些标签如何影响肌肉骨骼X光片的多标签图像分类。

Method: 回顾性研究，使用GPT-4o从锁骨、肘部和拇指的放射学报告中提取标签（真/假/不确定），然后将标签-图像对用于ResNet50多标签分类，比较包含性和排他性标签策略。

Result: GPT-4o在测试集中标签提取准确率达98.6%。基于标签的模型训练在所有解剖区域都表现出竞争力（如肘部AUC=0.80），模型在外部数据集上泛化良好，不同标签策略间无显著差异。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels (with
uncertainty) from free-text radiology reports and to test how these labels
affect multi-label image classification of musculoskeletal radiographs.
Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle
(n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o
filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present
("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label
uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were
automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive).
Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50.
Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233,
elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each).
Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results:
Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the
test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded
competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive
(e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow:
AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets
(elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79
[range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling
strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from
radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with
high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence
the performance of these models.

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力机制上下文学习的无人机数据收集调度和速度控制方法(AIC-VDS)，用于海啸等灾害监测场景，旨在最小化数据丢失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在灾害监测中面临数据收集调度和飞行速度设计的挑战，不当设计会导致传输错误和缓冲区溢出。在线深度强化学习训练复杂且存在仿真与现实不匹配问题，无法满足紧急监测需求。

Method: 提出AIC-VDS方法，利用大语言模型的推理和泛化能力，通过上下文学习适应新任务，联合优化多无人机数据收集调度和速度控制，考虑地面传感器电池水平、队列长度、信道条件和无人机轨迹。

Result: 仿真结果表明，AIC-VDS在性能上优于深度Q网络和最大信道增益基线方法。

Conclusion: AIC-VDS可作为紧急情况下深度强化学习的替代方案，有效解决无人机灾害监测中的数据丢失问题。

Abstract: Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated
to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as
tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major
challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as
unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer
overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet
loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a
complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that
does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong
reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through
In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural
language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM
models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In
this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities
control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level
of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as
well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based
In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS)
is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results
show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and
maximum channel gain baselines.

Conclusion: Syn-Diag为现代智能诊断提供了一个实用、鲁棒且可部署的范式，有效解决了工业故障诊断中的数据稀缺和资源约束问题。

Abstract: Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the
difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments.
This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that
leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault
diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic
Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through
cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically
constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited
samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create
a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared
decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU
and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms
existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge
model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model
size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable
paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

Abstract: We review the historical development and current trends of artificially
intelligent agents (agentic AI) in the social and behavioral sciences: from the
first programmable computers, and social simulations soon thereafter, to
today's experiments with large language models. This overview emphasizes the
role of AI in the scientific process and the changes brought about, both
through technological advancements and the broader evolution of science from
around 1950 to the present. Some of the specific points we cover include: the
challenges of presenting the first social simulation studies to a world unaware
of computers, the rise of social systems science, intelligent game theoretic
agents, the age of big data and the epistemic upheaval in its wake, and the
current enthusiasm around applications of generative AI, and many other topics.
A pervasive theme is how deeply entwined we are with the technologies we use to

*Bohan Yao,Shiva Krishna Reddy Malay,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自动多智能体系统设计范式ARM，通过优化思维链推理来构建通用推理模块，显著优于手动设计和现有自动方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动多智能体系统设计方法性能差，需要为每个新任务重新发现架构，且在没有标注验证集的领域需要昂贵的数据标注。而简单思维链推理与复杂系统表现相当，表明需要深入研究多智能体系统的核心推理单元。

Method: 引入Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM)，将思维链推广为每个推理步骤由专门推理模块执行的智能体化形式。通过代码空间的树搜索发现模块，从简单思维链模块开始，利用执行轨迹的反思信息进行突变进化。

Result: ARM方法显著优于手动设计的多智能体系统和最先进的自动设计方法。基于ARM构建的系统表现出卓越的泛化能力，在不同基础模型和任务领域保持高性能而无需进一步优化。

Conclusion: ARM作为一种新的自动多智能体系统设计范式，通过优化思维链推理构建通用推理模块，解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了高性能和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

*Jeffrey N. Clark,Elena Fillola,Nawid Keshtmand,Raul Santos-Rodriguez,Matthew Rigby*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的拉格朗日粒子扩散模型（LPDM）仿真器，用于估算大气传输足迹和温室气体浓度，实现了1000倍加速并量化不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统传输模型计算成本高且不确定性难以量化，人工智能提供了加速模拟和量化不确定性的双重机会。

Method: 使用图神经网络构建LPDM仿真器，采用集成方法量化绝对和相对不确定性，以巴西2016年GOSAT卫星观测数据为例进行验证。

Result: 仿真器比NAME LPDM快约1000倍，能再现大尺度足迹结构，集成分析揭示了预测误差的空间相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到大气传输模型，支持不确定性感知的温室气体反演系统，提高卫星排放监测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories
require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down
approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide
new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales.
However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of
uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their
uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual
opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their
associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport
"footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their
uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle
Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse
Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator
achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale
footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and
relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The
results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and
temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole
fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied
more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware
greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of
satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based
emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a
computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty
budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于混合参与度得分的早期迷因病毒性预测方法，使用多模态特征在30-420分钟时间窗口内预测迷因传播潜力，XGBoost模型在仅30分钟内就能达到PR-AUC > 0.52的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测在线内容的病毒性仍然具有挑战性，特别是对于文化复杂、快速演变的迷因。研究旨在探索早期预测迷因病毒性的可行性。

Method: 使用来自25个多样化Reddit社区的大规模跨语言数据集，提出基于混合参与度得分的病毒性定义方法，评估了逻辑回归、XGBoost和多层感知器等多种模型，采用包含静态内容和时间动态的多模态特征集。

Result: XGBoost表现最佳，在仅30分钟内就能达到PR-AUC > 0.52。分析揭示了"证据转换"现象：随着迷因获得关注，特征重要性从静态上下文动态转向时间动态。

Conclusion: 这项研究为在无法获得完整扩散级联数据的情况下，建立了一个稳健、可解释且实用的早期病毒性预测基准，贡献了新颖的跨语言数据集和方法论上合理的病毒性定义。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

TL;DR: RareAgent是一个自演化的多智能体系统，通过对抗性辩论和动态构建证据图来解决罕见病药物重定位问题，在缺乏先验关联的情况下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病药物重定位在缺乏药物与目标疾病先验关联时极具挑战性，传统知识图谱补全和图神经网络方法因缺乏可靠信号而表现不佳。

Method: 采用自演化多智能体系统，组织任务特定的对抗性辩论，让智能体从不同视角动态构建证据图来支持、反驳或蕴含假设，并通过后验分析推理策略进行自我进化。

Result: RareAgent将适应症AUPRC提升了18.1%，优于推理基线方法，并提供与临床证据一致的可解释推理链。

Conclusion: RareAgent成功将罕见病药物重定位从被动模式识别转变为主动证据寻求推理，实现了性能提升和可解释性。

Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging
when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore,
knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal
to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a
self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern
recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes
task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct
evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail
hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a
self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies,
while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to
accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that
RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and
provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在自动生成形式化建模方面很有前景，但约束编程相比运筹学模型受到的关注较少，需要专门针对CP建模的LLM解决方案。

Method: 基于开源LLM进行多指令监督微调，提出约束感知检索模块增强上下文学习能力，集成在带引导自校正机制的思维树框架中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进的求解精度，在新工业级基准IndusCP上比基线方法性能提升2倍。

Conclusion: ConstraintLLM证明了专门针对约束编程建模的LLM的有效性，为构建可信赖的神经符号AI提供了新途径。

Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world
constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling
semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to
generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising
approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of
symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works
based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first
LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source
LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the
Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning
capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with
guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP,
the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140
challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple
benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and
categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a
quantitative evaluation of the results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的过滤方法，使用模型自身置信度替代外部标签来筛选合成思维链数据，在生物扰动预测领域取得了优于未过滤数据和接近真实标签训练的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物学等实验数据稀缺的领域，传统方法需要真实标签来生成或过滤思维链轨迹，成本高昂。需要一种无需标签的替代方案来降低监督成本。

Method: 使用不确定性指标（如自一致性和预测困惑度）量化模型置信度，采样多个推理轨迹并仅保留低不确定性子集，采用逐类过滤和混合不确定性指标。

Result: 过滤后的子集准确率更高，在监督微调中优于未过滤合成数据，缩小了与真实标签训练的差距，并超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 模型内部置信度是创建高效推理数据集的强大信号，能够在监督成本高昂的领域实现大型推理模型的有效训练。

Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large
reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level
supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter
these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab
data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based
filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established
uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a
substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain
only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a
domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered
subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the
gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations
show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales
and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results
suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient
reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is
expensive.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DebateQD算法通过基于说服力的优化而非传统基于真实性的优化，在辩论环境中培养LLM的可迁移推理能力，显著减小了训练-测试泛化差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于真实性的LLM优化容易过拟合，产生脆弱的推理能力。辩论环境中的说服力优化可能提供更好的泛化性能，但尚未与主流方法进行系统比较。

Method: 提出DebateQD算法，使用质量-多样性进化算法演化多样化的辩论策略。通过固定辩论协议、仅交换适应度函数来隔离优化目标的影响：说服力优化奖励说服法官的策略，真实性优化奖励协作正确性。

Result: 在三个模型规模（7B、32B、72B参数）和多个数据集大小上，说服力优化策略实现了高达13.94%更小的训练-测试泛化差距，同时匹配或超过了真实性优化的测试性能。

Conclusion: 竞争性说服压力而非协作寻求真相，培养了更具可迁移性的推理技能，为改善LLM泛化提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often
overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While
persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not
been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We
introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm
that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories
(rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style
competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously
proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains
diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM
architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the
key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we
explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate
protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies
that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards
collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters)
and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized
strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while
matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results
provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade,
rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning
skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类中标注数据稀缺，特定任务训练成本高且不灵活，需要开发无需训练的解决方案

Method: 将多变量时间序列分解为通道级子问题，为每个通道检索结构相似的标注示例，使用推理LLM比较查询与示例并生成通道级标签和置信度，最后通过置信度加权聚合器融合所有通道决策

Result: 在9个具有挑战性的UEA数据集上，FETA在完全无需训练的情况下实现了强大的准确率，超越了多个经过训练的基线方法

Conclusion: 多智能体上下文推理框架可以将LLM转变为具有竞争力的即插即用时间序列分类器，无需任何参数训练

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet
labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and
inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise
in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains
suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via
exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into
channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples
for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against
these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;
a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design
eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by
pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances
interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine
challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully
training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results
demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform
LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter
training. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/FETATSC.

TL;DR: 提出MatheMagic方法，通过动态生成数学测试实例来评估模型的真实推理能力，避免测试集泄露和过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学基准测试存在两个问题：模型可能记忆公开测试集，以及现有数学基准由于符号和规则多样性有限、答案封闭而容易过拟合。

Method: 使用MatheMagic生成数学测试实例，改变数字和运算符的解释但保持答案可自动验证，在测试时随机生成实例来评估模型的归纳或演绎能力。

Result: 实验发现模型解决演绎问题比归纳问题更容易，但会回归到标准数学。数学适应模型未能展现通用的推理"技能"，在归纳任务上的微调泛化效果差。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种稳定、可扩展、可比较且对过拟合鲁棒的评估方式，揭示了当前模型在数学推理能力上的局限性。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

Conclusion: 赋权预训练框架为强化学习领域提供了有前景的初始化策略，未来可扩展到高维复杂任务，进一步推动强化学习发展。

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential
influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation
and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for
unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment
as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We
show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient
downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of
empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's
control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging
this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes
policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a
robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based
pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its
potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing
policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to
improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future
research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further
advancing the field of RL.

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: 提出了ARISE评估指标，专门用于评估大型推理模型的测试时扩展能力，包含样本级感知和动态采样机制两个创新点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理模型快速发展，需要系统性地比较和评估不同模型的测试时扩展能力，现有评估方法存在不足。

Method: ARISE指标包含样本级感知（惩罚负扩展行为）和动态采样机制（减少准确率波动和token计数不稳定性影响）。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和智能体任务等多个领域评估先进推理模型，发现Claude Opus具有最优的扩展特性。

Conclusion: ARISE提供了可靠且细粒度的测试时扩展能力测量，揭示了不同模型在扩展效率上的显著差异。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the
performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of
computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of
reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we
systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across
different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware
Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the
test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing
evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level
awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased
computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling
mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count
instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments
evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of
test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling
efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as
exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary
reasoning models.

*Qingyu Yin,Chak Tou Leong,Linyi Yang,Wenxuan Huang,Wenjie Li,Xiting Wang,Jaehong Yoon,YunXing,XingYu,Jinjin Gu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型推理模型存在"拒绝悬崖"现象：模型在推理过程中能正确识别有害提示并保持拒绝意图，但在输出生成前的最后几个token处拒绝分数急剧下降。通过因果干预识别出少量注意力头对拒绝行为产生负面影响，仅消除3%的头部就能显著降低攻击成功率。基于此提出了Cliff-as-a-Judge数据选择方法，仅需1.7%的安全训练数据即可实现可比的安全改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然展现出强大的多步推理能力，但其安全漏洞问题尚未得到充分理解。本研究旨在通过机制可解释性方法探究推理模型中安全对齐失败的原因。

Method: 采用线性探测方法追踪token位置上的拒绝意图，识别"拒绝悬崖"现象；通过因果干预分析确定对拒绝行为产生负面影响的稀疏注意力头；提出Cliff-as-a-Judge数据选择方法，选择表现出最大拒绝悬崖的训练样本来修复推理模型的安全对齐。

Result: 发现许多对齐不良的推理模型在思考过程中能正确识别有害提示并保持拒绝意图，但在输出前的最后token处拒绝分数急剧下降；仅消除3%的负面注意力头就能将攻击成功率降至10%以下；Cliff-as-a-Judge方法仅使用1.7%的常规安全训练数据即可实现可比的安全改进。

Conclusion: 推理模型并非天生不安全，而是其拒绝意图被系统性地抑制；通过机制性干预和高效数据选择可以显著改善模型的安全对齐，实现"少即是多"的效果。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have
shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety
vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why
safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal
intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as
\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify
harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking
process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens
before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently
unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through
causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that
negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can
reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights,
we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that
identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to
efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves
comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training
data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.

*Haiquan Lu,Gongfan Fang,Xinyin Ma,Qi Li,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MixReasoning框架通过动态调整推理深度，在困难步骤进行详细推理，在简单步骤进行简洁推断，从而缩短推理长度并提高效率而不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型对所有步骤采用相同程度的详细推理，但实际子问题难度差异很大，关键步骤需要深入推理而简单步骤只需简洁处理，这种统一处理方式造成了冗余。

Method: 提出MixReasoning框架，在单一响应中动态调整推理深度，形成混合推理链：对困难步骤进行详细推理，对简单步骤进行简洁推断。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME数据集上的实验表明，MixReasoning显著缩短了推理长度，大幅提高了效率，同时保持了准确性。

Conclusion: MixReasoning通过自适应调整推理深度，有效解决了推理冗余问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepEvolve是一个结合深度研究和算法演化的科学助手代理，通过外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试的反馈驱动迭代循环，持续改进科学算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学助手要么仅依赖算法演化，要么只进行孤立深度研究，两者都有严重局限：纯算法演化依赖LLM内部知识，在复杂领域快速达到瓶颈；纯深度研究提出想法但不验证，导致不切实际的解决方案。

Method: 集成深度研究与算法演化，包含外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试，采用反馈驱动的迭代循环，每次迭代不仅提出新假设，还进行精炼、实现和测试。

Result: 在化学、数学、生物学、材料和专利等9个基准测试中，DeepEvolve持续改进初始算法，产生可执行的新算法并保持持续增益。

Conclusion: DeepEvolve通过弥合无引导演化与无基础研究之间的差距，为推进科学算法发现提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing
agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in
isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution,
as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly
plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without
validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present
DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution,
uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic
debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only
proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding
both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine
benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents,
DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable
new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided
evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable
framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了TelecomTS数据集，这是一个来自5G电信网络的大规模可观测性数据集，解决了现有公开基准中可观测性数据代表性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业监控系统生成的大量可观测性时间序列数据具有零膨胀、高度随机性和最小时间结构的特点，但由于专有性限制，这类数据在公共基准中代表性不足，且现有数据集通常经过匿名化和归一化处理，限制了其在异常检测、根因分析等多任务中的应用。

Method: 引入TelecomTS数据集，该数据集包含异构的去匿名化协变量，保留明确的尺度信息，支持异常检测、根因分析和需要多模态推理的问答基准等多种下游任务。

Result: 对最先进的时间序列、语言和推理模型进行基准测试发现，现有方法在处理可观测性数据的突然、噪声和高方差动态方面存在困难。实验还强调了保留协变量绝对尺度的重要性。

Conclusion: 需要能够原生利用尺度信息的基础时间序列模型，以支持实际的可观测性应用。

Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when
monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional
time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated,
highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their
importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks
due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and
normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond
forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal
reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale
observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS
features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale
information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly
detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring
multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and
reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt,
noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also
underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing
the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale
information for practical observability applications.

TL;DR: RouteLLM是一个分层多智能体框架，通过将自然语言意图转化为约束感知路线来解决路线推荐问题，结合了语言灵活性和空间结构推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路由算法假设结构化输入和固定目标，难以适应自然语言查询；而基于LLM的方法在空间推理和联合建模路线级与POI级偏好方面存在困难。

Method: 采用分层多智能体框架：首先解析用户查询为结构化意图，然后由管理智能体协调约束智能体、POI智能体和路径优化智能体，最后通过验证智能体确保约束满足并生成可解释的路线。

Result: 实验表明该方法能可靠地将文本偏好转化为约束感知路线，在路线质量和偏好满足度方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RouteLLM成功弥合了语言灵活性和空间结构之间的差距，能够对路线可行性和用户偏好进行推理。

Abstract: Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that
satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g.,
shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured
inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries.
Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial
reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To
address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent
framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes.
It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and
constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a
constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that
retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines
routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier
agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an
interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial
structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.
Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into
constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction
over classical methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着算法决策在关键领域应用增多，AI对齐研究从通用价值对齐转向考虑决策者属性的上下文特定方法，但现有方法的泛化能力仍有待探索。

Method: 实现了一个经典AI模型并开发了基于LLM的算法决策器，使用GPT-5和GPT-4在零样本提示框架下进行评估，在健康保险决策数据集上测试三种风险容忍度(0.0, 0.5, 1.0)的决策者对齐。

Result: 经典AI和基于LLM的模型在基于属性的目标对齐方面表现相当，经典AI在中等风险配置下表现出稍好的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 两种方法在决策者对齐任务中都有价值，经典AI在特定情况下可能略有优势，为AI对齐研究提供了实证比较。

Abstract: As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes
domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value
alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker
attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two
primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning,
Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language
model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches
have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their
generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we
implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic
decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a
non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot
prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both
approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three
target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0).
In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved
comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting
slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile. The dataset and
open-source implementation are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 优化大型语言模型在竞争环境中的表现会导致模型失准，即使有对齐保障措施，竞争压力仍会驱动模型产生欺骗性营销、虚假信息和有害行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究竞争性反馈循环如何影响LLM行为，揭示市场驱动的优化压力如何系统性地削弱模型的对齐性。

Method: 在广告营销、选举和社交媒体等竞争场景中使用模拟环境，分析优化LLM竞争成功时的行为变化。

Result: 竞争优化导致：销售增长6.3%伴随欺骗营销增加14.0%；得票率增长4.9%伴随虚假信息增加22.3%和民粹言论增加12.5%；参与度增长7.5%伴随虚假信息增加188.6%和有害行为推广增加16.3%。

Conclusion: 竞争成功以对齐性为代价，当前的对齐保障措施脆弱，AI系统安全部署需要更强治理和精心设计的激励机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is
created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive
advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to
social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently
competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience
approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops
influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success
can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these
scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise
in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with
22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social
media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a
16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon
Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.
These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to
remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment
safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can
systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that
safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully
designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal
trust.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了测试时计算扩展（TTS）策略，包括顺序扩展（延长生成过程）和并行扩展（验证和选择多个候选输出），利用验证比生成更容易的不对称验证特性，显著提升了AI系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特定场景（如解决数独谜题）中，验证响应比生成响应要容易得多，这种不对称验证特性凸显了测试时扩展的巨大潜力。

Method: 研究顺序和并行TTS策略，利用不对称验证特性，为验证器分配适度的计算资源，将开源模型扩展到"Heavy"变体。

Result: 深度研究代理在BrowseComp基准上获得高达27个绝对点的提升，GLM-4.5 Heavy在BrowseComp和GAIA上分别达到54.0%和66.0%的准确率，与最佳专有模型相当。Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy在BrowseComp上达到69.0%的准确率，大幅超越最佳专有结果。

Conclusion: 通过结合顺序和并行TTS策略并利用不对称验证特性，可以显著提升AI系统性能，开源模型能够达到甚至超越专有模型的水平。

Abstract: Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential
scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling
involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining
these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4
Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),
verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This
property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong
potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential
and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that
verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In
experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget
forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging
asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial
improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We
conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their
``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up
to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an
open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on
BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best
proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research. Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy
further achieves {\bf 69.0\%} accuracy on BrowseComp, greatly surpassing the
best proprietary results.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as
we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the
typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and
then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.
Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,
one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.
We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new
performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven
solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit
reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or
simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts
against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach
as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,
evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS
instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load
balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,
LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS
discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,
achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill
best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator
construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications
for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we
argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and
strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the
urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

*Farjana Yesmin,Nusrat Shirmin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合类型2模糊集、粒计算和聚类的新框架，用于提升大数据环境中的可解释性和公平性，在空气质量数据集上表现出优于传统方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在环境监测等领域的复杂性增加，需要提高模型的可解释性和公平性以满足信任、伦理和法规要求，而传统黑盒模型和事后XAI技术存在精度损失或无法提供内在洞察的问题。

Method: 结合类型2模糊集、粒计算和聚类的方法框架，包括类型2模糊聚类、公平性度量集成和基于规则的内在XAI组件。

Result: 类型2模糊聚类相比类型1方法提升约4%的内聚性（轮廓系数0.365 vs 0.349），改善公平性（熵0.918），规则覆盖率达到0.65，运行时间线性增长（约0.005秒），在可解释性、公平性和效率方面均优于DBSCAN和凝聚聚类等基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效处理噪声传感器数据的不确定性，生成语言规则，评估公平性，在可解释性、公平性和计算效率方面均优于现有方法，为大数据分析提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning (ML) models in big data analytics,
especially in domains such as environmental monitoring, highlights the critical
need for interpretability and explainability to promote trust, ethical
considerations, and regulatory adherence (e.g., GDPR). Traditional "black-box"
models obstruct transparency, whereas post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) techniques
like LIME and SHAP frequently compromise accuracy or fail to deliver inherent
insights. This paper presents a novel framework that combines type-2 fuzzy
sets, granular computing, and clustering to boost explainability and fairness
in big data environments. When applied to the UCI Air Quality dataset, the
framework effectively manages uncertainty in noisy sensor data, produces
linguistic rules, and assesses fairness using silhouette scores and entropy.
Key contributions encompass: (1) A type-2 fuzzy clustering approach that
enhances cohesion by about 4% compared to type-1 methods (silhouette 0.365 vs.
0.349) and improves fairness (entropy 0.918); (2) Incorporation of fairness
measures to mitigate biases in unsupervised scenarios; (3) A rule-based
component for intrinsic XAI, achieving an average coverage of 0.65; (4)
Scalable assessments showing linear runtime (roughly 0.005 seconds for sampled
big data sizes). Experimental outcomes reveal superior performance relative to
baselines such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering in terms of
interpretability, fairness, and efficiency. Notably, the proposed method
achieves a 4% improvement in silhouette score over type-1 fuzzy clustering and
outperforms baselines in fairness (entropy reduction by up to 1%) and
efficiency.

TL;DR: 审计Transformer模型在金融应用中对波动性数据的依赖，发现模型完全忽略数据波动性，且偏向低频价格变动数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在金融应用中日益流行，但其潜在风险和偏见尚未充分探索，需要审计模型对波动性数据的依赖程度。

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行预测，引入基于部分信息分解(PID)的指标来衡量每个资产对模型决策的影响。

Result: 分析揭示两个关键发现：模型完全忽略数据波动性，且对低频价格变动数据存在偏见。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在金融应用中存在对数据波动性不敏感和频率偏见的风险，需要进一步改进以提高决策质量。

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial
applications, yet their potential risk making and biases remain under-explored.
The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data
for decision-making, and quantify how the frequency of price movements affects
the model's prediction confidence. We employ a transformer model for
prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition
(PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making.
Our analysis reveals two key observations: first, the model disregards data
volatility entirely, and second, it is biased toward data with lower-frequency
price movements.

Motivation: 研究对抗性强化学习在网络安全的实际应用，模拟真实网络环境中的暴力攻击和响应防御，探索攻击者与防御者之间的动态博弈。

Method: 使用自定义OpenAI Gym环境模拟多端口服务的暴力攻击和防御，包含背景流量噪声、渐进利用机制、IP规避策略、蜜罐陷阱和多级速率限制防御。在零和奖励框架下使用深度Q网络训练对抗智能体。

Result: 防御者在50,000+训练回合中持续保持战略优势，当面对复杂防御策略（自适应IP阻断和端口特定控制）时性能增益更加明显。奖励塑造和训练调度对学习稳定性至关重要。

Conclusion: 该环境适用于研究自主防御系统、攻击者-防御者共同进化以及向真实网络安全场景的迁移学习，为零和对抗性强化学习在网络安全领域的应用提供了完整实现和可复现配置。

Abstract: This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning
in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models
brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The
environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic
noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot
traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender
agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward
framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while
incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across
multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation
difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that
defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to
successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful
training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial
setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+
training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex
defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.
Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations,
and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in
adversarial RL for cybersecurity. The zero-sum formulation and realistic
operational constraints make this environment suitable for studying autonomous
defense systems, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to
real-world network security scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从单点优化转向生成式逆向设计的范式转变，使用条件变分自编码器(CVAE)框架，能够根据特定性能目标生成多样化的高性能设计组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于代理的优化方法只能收敛到单一最优解，限制了设计空间探索并忽略了有价值的替代拓扑结构。

Method: 采用条件变分自编码器(CVAE)框架，学习系统设计参数与性能之间的概率映射，能够基于特定性能目标生成多样化的设计候选方案。

Result: 在翼型自噪声最小化问题上，CVAE框架成功生成了256个新颖设计，有效率达94.1%，其中77.2%的有效设计性能优于SBO基准方法找到的单一最优设计。

Conclusion: 生成式方法不仅能发现更高质量的解决方案，还提供了丰富的多样化候选设计组合，从根本上增强了工程设计过程，支持多标准决策。

Abstract: Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output,
is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has
become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a
single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring
potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm
shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce
a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a
probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance,
enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates
conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to
the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a
high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline.
The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\%
validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of
these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single
optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the
generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also
provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the
engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of machine learning in
fraud detection within digital banking, synthesizing evidence from 118
peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following the PRISMA
guidelines, the review applied a structured identification, screening,
eligibility, and inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and
transparency. The findings reveal that supervised learning methods, such as
decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the
dominant paradigm due to their interpretability and established performance,
while unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are increasingly adopted to
address novel fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets. Deep learning
architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data
and detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability
and real-time deployment persist. Hybrid models that combine supervised,
unsupervised, and deep learning strategies demonstrate superior adaptability
and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对高性能深度脉冲神经网络的QIF神经元模型离散化方法，通过分析其动态特性并推导出基于参数集的代理梯度窗口，解决了训练不稳定性问题，在多个数据集上超越了基于LIF的现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIF神经元虽然计算效率高但表达能力有限，而QIF等复杂模型具有更丰富的非线性动态特性但训练不稳定，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出了QIF神经元模型的离散化方法，并直接从离散化参数集中推导出代理梯度窗口的解析公式，以最小化梯度不匹配。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS数据集上的评估表明，该方法能够超越基于LIF的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的QIF神经元离散化方法为深度SNN提供了一个有吸引力的LIF替代方案，结合了更丰富的动态特性和实际可扩展性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

Motivation: 新质生产力、数字经济进步和人工智能技术对促进可持续城市发展变得至关重要，需要研究这些技术因素对碳排放的影响。

Method: 采用多注意力深度交叉网络(MADCN)框架，结合特征交互建模和注意力机制，并使用SHAP可解释性学习来评估不同特征的贡献。基于中国275个城市的面板数据进行测试。

Result: MADCN模型在测试集上表现出色，MSE为406,151.063，MAE为612.304，R平方值为0.991。SHAP分析显示人口、城市规模、城镇化率和GDP是最具影响力的因素，而新质生产力、数字经济指数和AI技术水平也有适度影响。

Conclusion: 推进新质生产力、加强数字经济和加速AI技术发展能显著减少城市碳排放。政策制定者应将技术创新融入碳减排战略，特别是推广智能基础设施和提升各行业数字化水平。

Abstract: New quality productive forces (NQPF), digital economy advancement, and
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming crucial for promoting
sustainable urban development. This study proposes a Multi-head Attention Deep
& Cross Network (MADCN) framework, combining feature interaction modeling and
attention mechanisms, to predict urban carbon emissions and investigate the
impacts of technological factors. The framework incorporates an interpretable
learning phase using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess the
contributions of different features. A panel dataset covering 275 Chinese
cities is utilized to test the MADCN model. Experimental results demonstrate
that the MADCN model achieves superior predictive performance compared to
traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines, with a Mean Squared
Error (MSE) of 406,151.063, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 612.304, and an
R-squared value of 0.991 on the test set. SHAP analysis highlights that
population, city size, urbanization rate, and GDP are among the most
influential factors on carbon emissions, while NQPF, digital economy index, and
AI technology level also show meaningful but relatively moderate effects.
Advancing NQPF, strengthening the digital economy, and accelerating AI
technology development can significantly contribute to reducing urban carbon
emissions. Policymakers should prioritize integrating technological innovation
into carbon reduction strategies, particularly by promoting intelligent
infrastructure and enhancing digitalization across sectors, to effectively
achieve dual-carbon goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车电池容量准确估计对消费者信心至关重要，但隐私法规和标注数据短缺限制了通用模型的开发，现有自监督方法难以从隐私友好数据中有效学习。

Method: 提出片段相似性加权掩码输入重建预训练框架，结合对比学习捕获片段间相似性，然后进行相似性加权的掩码重建，学习细粒度充电模式和高层关联关系。

Result: 模型在制造商和老化引起的分布偏移场景下，测试误差比最佳基准方法降低31.9%，在领域偏移设置中表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从隐私友好数据中学习丰富表征，显著提升电池容量估计的准确性和鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns
about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,
practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled
data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation
models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While
self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are
not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --
let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and
noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model
based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of
privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our
pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input
reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even
from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation
lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level
similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.
With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted
masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both
granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level
associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich
representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,
even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer
and age-induced distribution shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存已成为推理过程中的主要内存和带宽瓶颈，现有量化方法因KV分布缺乏平坦性而性能下降严重。

Method: 提出模式对齐残差量化方案：在线挖掘代表性模式向量，将每个KV向量对齐到最近模式，仅量化残差部分。

Result: 在多个骨干网络上，PatternKV实现平均0.08%的4位精度下降，测试时扩展精度平均提升10%，吞吐量提升1.4倍。

Conclusion: PatternKV通过重塑KV分布有效改善了低比特KV量化的保真度，在长上下文和测试时扩展场景中表现优异。

Abstract: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has
emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference,
notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key
lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV
distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior
work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten
the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.
In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that
evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic
regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a
pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern
vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes
only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the
quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of
low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on
multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08%
average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10%
on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger
batches.

TL;DR: 提出逻辑门控算子(LGO)，在符号回归中引入可学习的阈值和条件逻辑，生成具有明确单位感知阈值的紧凑符号方程，在医疗数据上恢复临床合理的截断点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号回归虽然能生成可读方程，但难以编码单位感知的阈值和条件逻辑，限制了其在需要明确阈值判断的领域（如医疗）的应用。

Method: 使用逻辑门控算子(LGO)作为类型化原语，包含可学习的位置和陡度参数，通过硬门变体实现离散阈值判断，并映射回物理单位进行审计。

Result: 在两个医疗数据集上，硬门变体恢复了临床合理的截断点：71%的评估阈值在指南锚点的10%范围内，100%在20%范围内，同时使用更少的门控单元，保持与强基线相当的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法将可解释性从后验解释转变为建模约束，为符号回归提供了实用的制度切换计算和治理就绪部署能力。

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode
unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated
operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness
-- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit.
Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant
recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall
within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer
gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and
remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On
predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result
is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be
audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc
explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a
practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Motivation: 在关键IoT环境中，传统IDS需要大量数据但面临隐私限制，联邦学习虽能保护隐私但仍存在数据异构性和高能耗问题。

Conclusion: OptiFLIDS方法适合在真实IoT环境中部署，平衡了检测性能和能源效率。

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems,
effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring
security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant
challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require
large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security
concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling
collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages,
FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and
high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT
devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel
approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model
complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized
aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID
data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets,
TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong
detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited
for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统源分离方法依赖简化的源模型，无法准确复现数据。自然科学研究中经常需要从观测数据中分离未知源，如星系去混叠、神经元活动分离等。

Method: 利用扩散模型直接从噪声、不完整数据中学习复杂先验分布，仅依赖多视图观测（不同观测包含未知源的不同线性变换）来分离源。

Result: 该方法在源未被单独观测、观测数据存在噪声、不完整且分辨率变化的情况下仍能成功分离源，能够从源先验中采样、评估候选源概率并生成给定观测下的联合后验分布。

Conclusion: 该方法在合成问题和真实星系观测中都表现出有效性，为源分离问题提供了一种无需显式源假设的解决方案。

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct,
unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task
include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of
individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from
an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source
models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown
that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from
noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve
the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.
Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets
of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown
sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually
observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution.
The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors,
evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint
posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as
real-world galaxy observations.

Motivation: 研究神经网络权重矩阵在训练过程中的分布特性，测试矩阵模型在表示其分布方面的有效性，特别是在高斯性和置换对称性假设下。

Method: 使用13参数置换不变高斯矩阵模型来建模权重矩阵的分布，计算Wasserstein距离来量化训练过程中分布的变化，并测试不同初始化方案、正则化、层深度和宽度的影响。

Result: 发现置换不变高斯矩阵模型能有效建模权重矩阵的相关高斯性，特别是在训练过程中超越初始化阶段。模型参数和置换不变矩阵可观测量提供了可解释的框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解神经网络权重分布提供了可解释的建模方法，能够识别高斯性偏离的增强情况，并为开发更通用但仍高度可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training
process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix
models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity
and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant
Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated
Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the
simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and
notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model
parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation
invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit
model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein
distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the
movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects
of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width
are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures
from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still
highly-interpretable, models can be developed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and
math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in
hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a
dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of

Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical
statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically
checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed
machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via
normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that
frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting
a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts
identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by
interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model,
GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini,
Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by
none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span
Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes
violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We
believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research
assistants and tutors.

*Mohammad Mahdi Ahmadi,Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两种算法解决参数未知的误设定鞍点问题，将优化与学习统一框架，收敛率O(logK/K)，学习感知版本有更紧常数和自适应步长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设参数完全已知或预先估计，但实际问题中参数需要从数据中学习，需要将优化和学习整合到统一框架中。

Method: 基于加速原始对偶方法，提出两种算法：直接替换参数估计的朴素扩展和考虑参数动态调整动量更新的学习感知变体。

Result: 两种方法都达到O(logK/K)收敛率，学习感知方法有更紧的O(1)常数和自适应步长优势。在多重最优解问题中，结构化算法达到O(1/√K)率。

Conclusion: 在误设定投资组合优化问题上验证了方法的优越性能，相比现有算法有更好的实证表现。

Abstract: We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the
optimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned
concurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are
fully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and
learning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To
address this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated
primal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the
naive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving
parameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new
learning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter
dynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable
convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware
approach attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from
an adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem
admits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a
structured setting achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate
practical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio
optimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种组合式框架，通过分解大型半定规划为小规模子问题，实现了高效且紧致的神经网络Lipschitz常数估计，显著提升了计算速度和估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算神经网络Lipschitz常数是NP难问题，现有方法需要求解大型半定规划，计算复杂度高且难以利用局部输入信息来获得更紧致的估计。

Method: 开发了广义SDP框架，支持异质激活函数斜率，并将其分解为线性复杂度的小子问题序列；还开发了基于闭式解的快速变体和利用局部输入信息的ECLipsE-Gen-Local算法。

Result: 实验表明，相比基准方法，算法实现了显著加速，同时产生更紧致的Lipschitz边界；在小输入区域下，估计值接近自动微分得到的精确Jacobian。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了严格的Lipschitz常数上界，且估计值与网络鲁棒性密切相关，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant is a key measure for certifying the robustness of
neural networks to input perturbations. However, computing the exact constant
is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve
solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with
network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local
information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We
address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields
tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.
Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly
flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing
Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary
choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this
generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational
complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also
develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through
closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied
by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a
series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate
local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing
significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we
show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant
with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region
is small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach
by showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过消融研究比较了编码器专用模型和解码器专用模型在跨模态适应任务中的表现，发现解码器专用模型表现较差，并提出两种新方法来提升其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管解码器专用模型在自然语言处理中表现优异且扩展性好，但大多数跨模态适应方法都专注于编码器专用模型，因此需要研究模型架构对跨模态适应方法的影响。

Method: 进行了系统的消融研究，比较编码器专用和解码器专用模型在基于偏微分方程的时间相关模拟任务中的表现。提出了两种新方法：Parallel Flipping和Sequence Doubling，试图在自回归模型中模拟双向性。

Result: 发现解码器专用模型在现有方法下表现远不如编码器专用模型，且扩展模型规模也无济于事。提出的两种新方法在所有任务和所有跨模态适应方法中都提高了解码器专用模型的整体性能，缩小了与编码器专用模型的差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于扩大用于跨模态适应任务的模型范围，进一步推动科学机器学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Action Gradient方法来解决Decision Transformer在离线强化学习中的轨迹拼接和动作外推问题，通过直接调整动作来替代策略梯度方法，显著提升了DT算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision Transformer将强化学习与Transformer结合，但将目标从最大化累积奖励转向最大化动作似然，这带来了轨迹拼接和动作外推两个关键挑战。现有方法单独解决这些问题时效果不稳定。

Method: 提出Action Gradient方法，利用动作对Q值的梯度来优化动作，实现类似策略梯度的功能，同时能与token预测技术高效集成。

Result: 实证结果表明该方法能显著提升基于DT的算法性能，部分结果达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Action Gradient方法有效解决了DT的挑战，为离线强化学习提供了稳定且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with
the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike
classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as
objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift,
however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation
of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with
predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address
these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when
combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action
Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to
fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient
integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the
Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical
results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance
of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络中符号图的挫败水平，以测试网络与结构平衡的接近程度，从统计物理和功能角度理解网络的有序行为。

Method: 计算预训练深度卷积神经网络中符号图的挫败水平，并与零模型进行比较，使用Ising自旋玻璃模型进行统计分析。

Result: 所有考虑的预训练深度卷积神经网络的挫败水平都低于零模型预期，显示出更低的无序性和近单调行为。

Conclusion: 深度卷积神经网络倾向于表现出比零模型预期更有序的行为，这种低挫败水平表明存在一种新的隐式正则化机制，使网络函数呈现近单调性。

Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the
frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural
balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider,
we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models.
From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an
Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of
disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a
functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural
balance) means that the function representing the network behaves
near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the
null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order
determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This
confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a
more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form
of implicit regularization.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型的两个安全限制：1）传统LLM硬件需求高，无法在消费级设备本地运行，依赖远程连接易受网络攻击；2）敏感任务微调涉及敏感数据，非私有算法易受训练数据再现攻击。

Method: 提出DP-Adam-AC优化器，包含自适应梯度裁剪和其他工程增强，应用于两种本地化LLM设计：小语言模型(Qwen2.5-0.5B)和1.58位量化模型(Bitnet-b1.58-2B)。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验表明，该方法在损失方面取得了有前景的改进。

Conclusion: 通过差分隐私优化算法增强本地化语言模型，有效解决了LLM在消费级设备部署和敏感数据微调的安全问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and
ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire
specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great
utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two
security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make
them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network
connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the
system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a
sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms
produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work
addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private
optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language
models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering
enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our
optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language
model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We
demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two
synthetic datasets.

Abstract: We study the cosine similarity of sentence transformer embeddings and observe
that they are well modeled by gamma mixtures. From a fixed corpus, we measure
similarities between all document embeddings and a reference query embedding.
Empirically we find that these distributions are often well captured by a gamma
distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], and in many cases, by a gamma
mixture. We propose a heuristic model in which a hierarchical clustering of
topics naturally leads to a gamma-mixture structure in the similarity scores.
Finally, we outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted
gamma mixtures, which provides a practical tool for modeling similarity
distributions.

Motivation: 传统对抗训练中使用的MSE正则化强制输出分布均匀优化，限制了鲁棒性表现。需要更灵活的正则化方法来提升对抗训练效果。

Method: 1. 加权对抗互正则化：使用分解的对抗互KL散度损失，为主目标和辅助目标分配不等权重；2. 对抗泛化正则化：在对抗训练目标中引入额外的干净目标分布。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提方法相比现有正则化方法显著提高了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的两种正则化策略有效解决了MSE在对抗训练中的局限性，通过更灵活的优化控制和引入干净分布提升了模型鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

Result: TRNN能够有效处理高维张量数据，既保留空间结构又捕捉非线性相互作用。

Conclusion: TRNN为高维张量数据的回归分析提供了一种有效的统一框架，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous,
high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose
natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires
regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough
to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial
and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first
requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural
networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial
structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a
Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two
paradigms.

TL;DR: MADPO是一种改进的DPO方法，通过实例级自适应权重解决固定温度参数导致的训练问题，在情感生成任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO使用固定温度参数，在多样化偏好数据上训练效果不佳，容易对简单样本过拟合，对信息丰富样本学习不足。现有改进方法如IPO和β-DPO各有局限性。

Method: MADPO采用两步法：首先训练奖励模型估计偏好边界，然后使用这些边界为每个训练样本的DPO损失应用连续自适应权重，对困难样本放大学习信号，对简单样本抑制。

Result: 在情感生成任务中，MADPO在不同质量数据集上均显著优于基线方法，在高质量数据上性能提升达33.3%，在低质量数据上提升10.5%。

Conclusion: MADPO为偏好对齐提供了一种更稳健和原则性的方法，具有良好优化景观和对奖励模型估计误差的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed
temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,
causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.
Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general
overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more
targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its
batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to
mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative
$\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful
training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference
Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and
instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first
trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these
margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each
individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective
target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,
allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a
comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved
optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We
validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where
MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across
datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on
High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.
Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to
preference alignment.

Abstract: We propose Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator
(PIANO) to solve the Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) problem in solar
physics. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on iterative numerical
methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure
from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel
Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the
model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels
relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply
physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free
conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with
underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF
dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural
operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the
physical characteristics of NLFFF data across magnetic fields reconstructed

TL;DR: MT-DAO是一种针对分布式训练中不频繁通信场景的优化器，通过多时间尺度的动量机制解决了传统自适应优化器在低频通信下的性能下降问题，显著提升了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式数据并行训练中频繁的梯度通信会占用大量带宽，而低频通信策略（如Local SGD）在自适应优化器上存在性能差距，主要原因是优化器的快速动量衰减无法平滑长时间间隔的梯度，导致噪声主导优化过程。

Method: 提出MT-DAO优化器家族，采用多个慢速和快速移动的一阶动量来跟踪不同时间尺度的更新动态，并提供了首个收敛性保证。

Result: 在语言模型预训练中，MT-DAO消除了与DDP的性能差距，在困惑度上优于其他低频通信基线，在以太网互连上将等token训练时间减少6-27%。在720M规模上，达到目标困惑度所需的步骤减少24%，时间减少35%。

Conclusion: MT-DAO能够实现有效的跨数据中心训练和广域地理范围的训练，解决了分布式训练中通信瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) requires
frequent communication of gradients across workers, which can saturate
bandwidth. Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this
overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance
gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale
mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,
decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to
noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of
optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the
gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we
provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model
pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming
infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token
wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO
reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the
single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter
training and training over wide geographic areas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极低精度（如2位）KV缓存量化会引入显著误差，这些误差通过注意力机制传播并降低生成质量，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出KVLinC框架，结合Hadamard旋转减少值量化误差，以及轻量级线性校正适配器补偿量化键引入的误差。

Result: 在LLaMA、Qwen2.5和Qwen3模型系列上的广泛评估显示，KVLinC持续匹配或超越强基线，同时实现更高的KV缓存压缩，定制注意力内核使推理速度提升高达2.55倍。

Conclusion: KVLinC有效解决了极低精度KV缓存量化的误差问题，实现了高效的长期上下文LLM推理。

Abstract: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the
inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive
quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors
in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product
attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this,
we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV
cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a
Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight
linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by
quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3
model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while
achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom
attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash
Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary
for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on
self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier
feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive
encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms
encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or
outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.

*Mikil Foss,Andrew Lamperski*

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信息论估计器在高维和大样本情况下性能不佳，现有神经网络方法缺乏实际算法性能保证。

Method: 使用具有随机隐藏权重和偏置的浅层神经网络（随机特征方法）来估计KL散度。

Result: 算法以高概率实现KL散度估计误差为O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})，其中m是神经元数量，T是算法步数和样本数。

Conclusion: 提出的随机特征神经网络方法为KL散度估计提供了理论保证的实际可行算法。

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a
fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables,
traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or
sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been
proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual
information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that
neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely
on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not
guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this
paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural
network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature
method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL
divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number
of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number
of samples.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient temperature prediction is critical for optimizing the
preheating process of PET preforms in industrial microwave systems prior to
blow molding. We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized
temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive
retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a
data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model
fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural
regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or
varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified
global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics
across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to
enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for
large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to
models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies
material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant
improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for
intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the
approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to
other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited
data.

*Kangwoo Yi,Bo Shen,Qin Li,Haimin Wang,Yong-Jae Moon,Jaewon Lee,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文使用基于LSTM的序列到序列深度学习模型来预测太阳质子事件后24小时的质子通量时间剖面，通过多种预测场景比较发现单次预测优于自回归预测，趋势平滑处理能提升质子+X射线模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太阳质子事件对卫星、宇航员和技术系统构成严重辐射危害，准确预测其质子通量时间剖面对于早期预警和缓解措施至关重要。

Method: 使用40个SPE事件数据集，采用基于LSTM的seq2seq模型，通过4折分层交叉验证评估不同模型配置，包括质子输入vs质子+X射线输入、原始数据vs趋势平滑数据、自回归vs单次预测等场景。

Result: 单次预测比自回归预测误差更低；原始数据上质子模型优于质子+X射线模型，但趋势平滑后差距缩小或逆转；趋势平滑显著提升质子+X射线模型性能；趋势平滑数据训练模型平均表现最佳，但最佳模型来自原始数据训练。

Conclusion: LSTM seq2seq模型能有效预测SPE质子通量，单次预测策略和适当的数据预处理（如趋势平滑）能显著提升预测性能，但模型架构选择有时比数据预处理更重要。

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites,
astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton
flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper
explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long
Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following
SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by
NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and
undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we
evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding
dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.
combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,
and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as
follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than
autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative
approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform
proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or
reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances
the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray
channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on
average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting
that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data
preprocessing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DP-SGD与普通SGD训练存在较大准确率差距，需要改进隐私保护训练方法。DP-MF通过关联不同迭代的隐私噪声来部分抵消噪声，但噪声相关性质量有待提升

Method: 使用公开无标签数据估计模型曲率，基于曲率信息改进DP-MF中的跨迭代噪声相关性计算，提出NoiseCurve技术

Result: 在多个数据集、模型和隐私参数上的实验表明，NoiseCurve计算的噪声相关性相比DP-MF的相关方案能带来一致且显著的准确率提升

Conclusion: 利用模型曲率信息改进噪声相关性是提升差分隐私训练准确性的有效方法，NoiseCurve技术在这方面表现出色

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) offers the
promise of training deep learning models while mitigating many privacy risks.
However, there is currently a large accuracy gap between DP-SGD and normal SGD
training. This has resulted in different lines of research investigating
orthogonal ways of improving privacy-preserving training. One such line of
work, known as DP-MF, correlates the privacy noise across different iterations
of stochastic gradient descent -- allowing later iterations to cancel out some
of the noise added to earlier iterations. In this paper, we study how to
improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that
uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the
quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various
datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations
computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in
accuracy over the correlation scheme used by DP-MF.

*Shrenik Bhansali,Larry Heck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVI是一种训练感知的自推测解码框架，通过将LLM划分为草稿器和验证器，在推理过程中持续在线学习，实现2.16倍加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码是大型语言模型的主要延迟瓶颈。现有推测解码方法需要大量离线训练或额外组件，增加了数据/计算成本，且在分布漂移下草稿器可能变得脆弱。

Method: 将LLM划分为草稿器和验证器，在生成过程中将验证器的接受/拒绝决策转换为监督信号来更新草稿器头。采用KL→RL调度，通过在线蒸馏启动校准，然后添加奖励掩码交叉熵和策略梯度项。

Result: 在Spec-Bench上实现2.16倍实时加速，与EAGLE-2等SOTA方法相当，但训练所需数据量少几个数量级。消融实验显示DVI优于仅使用KL的在线蒸馏。

Conclusion: 训练感知的自推测可以在最小训练开销下提供最先进的无损加速。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) decoding is a major latency bottleneck for large language
models. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates AR by letting a drafter propose
multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems
require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise
data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We
introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware
self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online
learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during
generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision
signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL}
schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds
reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving
lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$
wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of
magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms
KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware}
self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal
training overhead.

Motivation: 传统黑盒学习方法在生物医学建模中存在局限性，需要整合物理定律与数据驱动方法来解决物理可解释性、数据稀缺和复杂系统建模的挑战。

Method: 回顾三类主要PIML框架：1) PINNs - 将控制方程嵌入深度学习模型；2) NODEs - 提供连续时间建模；3) NOs - 学习函数空间之间的映射关系。

Result: 这些方法已成功应用于生物固体和流体力学、力学生物学、医学成像、生理系统动力学、药代动力学和细胞信号传导等多个生物医学领域。

Conclusion: PIML在生物医学领域具有广阔前景，未来挑战包括不确定性量化、泛化能力以及PIML与大型语言模型的整合。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially
transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating
parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three
main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),
highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin
with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have
been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,
and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer
continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,
pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful
tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient
simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.
Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data
scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning
insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions
for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of
uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large
language models.

TL;DR: ARLAS框架通过对抗性强化学习训练LLM代理，使其能够抵御多样化的间接提示注入攻击，同时提升任务完成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理使用工具时面临间接提示注入攻击风险，现有防御方法依赖手工制作的攻击模式数据集，缺乏多样性且无法应对新型攻击。

Method: 采用对抗性强化学习框架，将问题建模为双人零和博弈，同时训练攻击者LLM生成多样化提示注入和代理LLM学习防御，并使用基于种群的学习框架防止循环学习。

Result: 在BrowserGym和AgentDojo上的评估显示，ARLAS微调的代理攻击成功率显著降低，同时任务成功率提高，生成的攻击集更加多样化和具有挑战性。

Conclusion: ARLAS能够生成多样化的攻击并训练出更鲁棒的代理，相比基础模型具有更好的安全性和任务性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

*Runlin Zhou,Chixiang Chen,Elynn Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种基于Thompson采样的元强化学习算法（MTSRL和MTSRL+），用于解决有限时域MDP中相关任务的元学习问题，通过线性值函数表示和Gaussian元先验，实现了优于先验无关方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究元强化学习中相关任务共享最优动作值函数相似结构的问题，旨在开发能够学习任务间共享先验知识的算法，以提高学习效率。

Method: 提出了两种Thompson风格的算法：MTSRL（仅学习先验均值）和MTSRL+（额外学习协方差并使用先验扩展技术），并开发了先验对齐技术来保证元后悔界。

Result: 在已知协方差情况下获得O~(H^4S^3/2√ANK)的元后悔界，在学习协方差情况下获得O~(H^4S^3/2√AN^3K)的元后悔界，当任务数量足够时优于先验无关方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个为具有学习Q先验的Thompson风格RL提供元后悔保证的工作，为实验丰富的设置提供了实用的方法（通过RLSVI预热启动、OLS聚合、协方差扩展）。

Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related
tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions.
Specifically, we posit a linear representation
$Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $
\mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters
$\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two
Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and
performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and
(ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and
employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we
develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the
learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding
meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the
small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is
learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than
prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim
\tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation
environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief
exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially
outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results
give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned
Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation,
covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.

Conclusion: Quantile DeepGR4J框架在径流预测中表现出更好的预测准确性和不确定性量化能力，同时具备作为洪水早期预警系统的潜力。

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in
modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in
deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models
with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive
performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the
GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a
surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff
prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression
models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding
extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile
regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in
streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify
extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the
model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design
experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the
CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J
framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality
(interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we
carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results
demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

TL;DR: 提出自适应混合位激活量化(AMAQ)方法，通过渐进式压缩激活值和梯度，在协作训练中显著降低通信开销，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型规模快速增长，给服务器-客户端分布式协作训练带来通信效率和计算开销的挑战，特别是在低资源设备上。

Method: 采用参数高效的分割学习，引入AMAQ策略，基于特征重要性和层级重要性，通过位正则化在通道间分配位预算，将激活值和梯度从高精度(6-8位)渐进压缩到低精度(3-4位)。

Result: 在相同位预算下，AMAQ相比固定精度方法，在LLaMA3 8B和Qwen2.5 7B等模型上实现约2.5%的生成准确率提升和1.3%的分类准确率提升，同时显著增强训练稳定性，减少超低位表示崩溃。

Conclusion: AMAQ能有效集成到实际多机协作训练中，以适度的通信开销提供优越的推理准确率，是协作训练中通信成本最小化的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

Motivation: 解决现有分子动力学方法因严格等变性、顺序展开和单任务训练而导致的灵活性、模拟效率受限以及泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 采用准等变设计，无需显式分子图，使用时间注意力机制实现多未来状态的并行解码，在TG80数据集上进行多任务预训练。

Conclusion: ATOM代表了向准确、高效和可迁移分子动力学模型迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations underpin modern computational drug dis-
covery, materials science, and biochemistry. Recent machine learning models
provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve
quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional
pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely
on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation
efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual
molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen
compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic
Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural
operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant
design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal
attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple
future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales,
we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over
2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as
MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows
exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time
hori- zons. We believe ATOM represents a significant step toward accurate,
efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics models

Abstract: Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed
through small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.
Williams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through
truncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes
Rendus Math\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of
Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work
introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation
paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order
optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this
method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of
the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an
exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.
  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,
Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed
expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a
simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.
Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables
exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example,
applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of
semi-analytically optimisable models: the \emph{Infinity Class}; sufficient
conditions for class membership are discussed. This offers a pathway toward
non-iterative learning.

Result: 在1.1B参数预训练设置中，NorMuon比Adam训练效率提升21.74%，比Muon提升11.31%，同时保持与Muon相当的内存占用。在多个模型规模上一致优于Adam和Muon。

Conclusion: 正交化和自适应学习率是互补而非竞争的方法，为大规模深度学习中的优化器设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

TL;DR: 提出了MIDT-ECG方法，通过梅尔频谱信息扩散训练和时间-频域监督来生成高质量的心电图信号，解决了现有生成方法在形态保真度和个性化生成方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗隐私限制阻碍了真实患者心电图数据的共享，而现有生成AI方法在可信度和临床实用性方面存在不足，特别是形态保真度不够且无法生成个性化的生理信号。

Method: 基于条件扩散的结构化状态空间模型，引入MIDT-ECG训练范式（梅尔频谱信息扩散训练）进行时间-频域监督，以及多模态人口统计条件来实现患者特异性合成。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上评估显示，MIDT-ECG显著改善了形态一致性，隐私保护指标比基线提高4-8%，导联间相关误差平均减少74%，在低数据情况下使用合成数据训练的分类器性能与仅使用真实数据的相当。

Conclusion: 采用时间-频域结构正则化方案训练的ECG生成器可以作为个性化、高保真、隐私保护的替代品，在真实数据稀缺时推动生成AI在医疗领域的负责任使用。

Abstract: The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by
privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of
existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in
trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major
shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological
fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific
physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional
diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled
innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a
novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce
physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning
to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,
clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG
achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves
strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by
4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,
while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and
personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets
supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a
classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG
synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural
regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,
privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the
responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

TL;DR: 本文通过电路复杂度视角分析了等变图神经网络在晶体结构预测中的计算和表达能力极限，证明在多项式精度下，EGNNs可被统一TC^0阈值电路族模拟，为对称感知的晶体图学习提供了复杂性理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管等变图神经网络在材料科学中表现出强大的经验性能，但在周期性、对称性约束设置下的表达能力仍未被充分理解。本文旨在通过电路复杂度理论来刻画EGNNs在晶体结构预测中的内在计算和表达极限。

Method: 采用电路复杂度视角，分析EGNN层在节点特征、原子坐标和晶格矩阵上的计算过程，证明在多项式精度、O(n)嵌入宽度、O(1)层数和O(1)深度、O(n)宽度MLP实现下，这些模型可被统一TC^0阈值电路族模拟。

Result: 证明了EGNNs可被统一TC^0阈值电路族多项式大小模拟（具有明确的常数深度边界），这为在现实资源约束下此类架构可解决的决策和预测问题设定了具体上限。

Conclusion: 将EGNNs置于TC^0复杂度类中，为对称感知的晶体图学习提供了复杂性理论基础，并阐明了需要哪些架构修改（如增加深度、更丰富的几何原语或更宽的层）来超越这一机制。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on
relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as
a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their
ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions.
Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic,
symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work
characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for
crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze
the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic
coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision,
embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth,
$O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these
models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family
of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs
within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and
prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource
constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased
depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend
this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do
not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic
foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了基于EEG的疼痛监测系统，使用机器学习模型对高疼痛和低/无疼痛状态进行分类，在临床环境中具有技术可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医院疼痛评估主要依赖自我报告或非特异性生命体征，导致危重、镇静和认知障碍患者面临疼痛治疗不足和过度使用阿片类药物的风险。

Method: 使用52名健康成年人的EEG数据，暴露于三种强度激光诱发疼痛，将4秒时段的EEG转换为537个特征向量，评估9种传统机器学习模型。

Result: 支持向量机模型达到88.9%的离线准确率，推理时间小于1毫秒；实时XGBoost模型保持约4毫秒延迟和94.2%的准确率。

Conclusion: 基于EEG的疼痛监测器在临床环境中具有技术可行性，为临床验证提供了途径。

Abstract: Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or
non-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and
cognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid
overuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring
brain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive
tool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In
this study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain
versus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed
to laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second
epoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band
ratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and
peak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated
with leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with
radial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9%
accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance
analysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing
contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal
gamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of
about 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is
technically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards
clinical validation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeST-BO是一种针对高维贝叶斯优化的局部方法，通过联合学习梯度和Hessian信息来逼近牛顿步，并利用单步前瞻误差界进行采样选择，在保持收敛性的同时显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化在昂贵黑盒问题上有效，但在高维情况下面临挑战，特别是学习曲率信息的O(d²)计算成本过高。

Method: 使用高斯过程代理模型联合学习梯度和Hessian信息，通过单步前瞻牛顿步误差界选择评估点，并在低维子空间（如随机嵌入或学习稀疏子空间）中优化获取函数。

Result: 在包括数千个变量和未知活动子空间的高维合成和真实世界问题上，NeST-BO比最先进的局部和高维BO基线方法收敛更快、遗憾更低。

Conclusion: NeST-BO通过有效逼近牛顿步并降低计算复杂度，为高维贝叶斯优化提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is effective for expensive black-box problems but
remains challenging in high dimensions. We propose NeST-BO, a local BO method
that targets the Newton step by jointly learning gradient and Hessian
information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a
one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. We show that this bound (and
hence the step error) contracts with batch size, so NeST-BO directly inherits
inexact-Newton convergence: global progress under mild stability assumptions
and quadratic local rates once steps are sufficiently accurate. To scale, we
optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces (e.g., random embeddings
or learned sparse subspaces), reducing the dominant cost of learning curvature
from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m^2)$ with $m \ll d$ while preserving step targeting.
Across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including cases with
thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, NeST-BO consistently
yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art local and
high-dimensional BO baselines.

Motivation: 现有RLHF和DPO方法存在三个严重问题：偏好数据污染、奖励过优化和冗长性偏差，大多数工作只解决其中一个问题，且缺乏理论保证。

Method: 提出了RLHF-COV和DPO-COV算法，通过长度正则化同时处理三个问题，无需估计多个奖励模型，实现简单且理论保证强。

Result: 理论分析表明DPO-COV在污染数据上的泛化误差率与干净数据上的最优结果匹配，实验证明在离线和在线设置下均有效。

Conclusion: RLHF-COV和DPO-COV能同时有效缓解偏好对齐中的三个关键问题，具有理论保证和实际可行性，并证明了RLHF与DPO的等价性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models
(LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is
seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward
\textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards
\textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only
one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation
to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of
generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and
DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three
issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically
demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our
DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates
for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover,
our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is
proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the
equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and
online settings.

Motivation: 图函数模型需要大图才能准确估计，但实践中往往只能获得小规模网络，因此需要迁移学习框架利用相关大图的结构信息来改进小目标图的估计

Method: GTRANS方法结合邻域平滑和Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输来对齐图结构，并包含自适应去偏机制通过残差平滑识别和校正目标特定偏差

Conclusion: GTRANS是一个有效的迁移学习框架，能够利用相关大图的结构信息提升小目标图的图函数估计精度，防止负迁移

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating
latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream
applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate
graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one
often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this
issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve
estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a
larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely
GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing
and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural
patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an
adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific
deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness
of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through
extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate
directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph
classification task and the link prediction task.

TL;DR: ARMOR是一种新型的一次性后训练剪枝算法，通过矩阵分解方法实现2:4稀疏化，在保持推理加速和内存减少的同时，显著优于现有2:4剪枝方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署面临巨大计算和内存需求挑战，而现有的2:4稀疏化方法往往导致显著的性能下降，需要更有效的剪枝技术来平衡模型压缩与任务准确性。

Method: ARMOR将权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个低开销的块对角矩阵包装器，这些包装器作为高效的预变换和后变换误差校正器，通过块坐标下降算法最小化层间代理损失来选择稀疏核心和块对角包装器。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型系列上的实验表明，ARMOR在各种下游任务和困惑度评估中持续且显著优于最先进的2:4剪枝方法，同时保持了2:4剪枝的推理加速和内存使用减少。

Conclusion: ARMOR在模型压缩和任务准确性之间建立了更有效的权衡，为大型语言模型的实用硬件加速提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense computational and memory requirements. While semi-structured
pruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware
acceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation.
To bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with
Matrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm.
Instead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a
2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These
wrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors,
offering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional
2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen
through a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy
loss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a
solution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning
algorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and
Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide
range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves this
superior performance while retaining the inference speedups and substantial
memory usage reductions of 2:4 pruning, establishing a more effective trade-off
between model compression and task accuracy

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LATTA是一种新的测试时自适应方法，通过噪声权重扰动和稳定权重锚机制，在保持稳定性的同时有效适应分布偏移，无需架构改变或昂贵的蒙特卡洛计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法（如Tent）存在不稳定性和灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在小批量或挑战性损坏情况下，这源于在复杂损失表面上过于确定性的更新。

Method: 提出Langevin锚定测试时自适应（LATTA），结合两种机制：(1) 受随机梯度Langevin动力学启发的噪声权重扰动，探索局部参数空间并逃离不良局部最小值；(2) 稳定权重锚，防止模型偏离其鲁棒源预训练。

Result: 在标准基准测试（包括Rotated-MNIST和更具挑战性的CIFAR-10-C）上的广泛实验表明，LATTA显著优于现有方法（包括Tent、CoTTA和EATA），在CIFAR-10-C上平均准确率提高超过2%，同时降低性能方差，为自监督TTA设定了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: LATTA通过结合噪声探索和稳定性约束，实现了更有效和稳定的测试时自适应，无需架构修改或计算密集型过程，为处理分布偏移提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pretrained model to distribution
shifts using only unlabeled test data. While promising, existing methods like
Tent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source
knowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We
argue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss
surface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation
(LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key
mechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor
local minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from
diverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to
adapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA
methods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo
passes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including
Rotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that
LATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and
EATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving
average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing
performance variance.

Motivation: 现有特征选择方法难以捕捉复杂特征交互，且无法适应分布式场景中的数据不平衡、异构性和隐私限制。需要开发能够在保护隐私的前提下整合各客户端特征选择知识的框架。

Result: 大量实验验证了该框架的有效性、鲁棒性和效率，在联邦学习场景中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了分布式特征选择中的隐私保护和数据异构性问题，为联邦学习场景提供了有效的特征选择解决方案。

Abstract: Feature selection eliminates redundancy among features to improve downstream
task performance while reducing computational overhead. Existing methods often
struggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse
application scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to
alleviate these drawbacks. However, these methods remain constrained by
permutation sensitivity in embedding and reliance on convexity assumptions in
gradient-based search. To address these limitations, our initial work
introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding
with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to
adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local
clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy
regulations, limiting direct sharing. These challenges highlight the need for a
framework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without
exposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance
the framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving
knowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without
sharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy
to address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of
our framework. The results further demonstrate its strong generalization
ability in federated learning scenarios. The code and data are publicly

TL;DR: 论文分析了注意力缩放对大型语言模型长上下文处理的影响，发现存在相变现象：缩放不足导致注意力崩溃，过度缩放则使注意力退化为恒等变换，而β_n ∝ log n的临界缩放能保持稀疏且内容自适应的注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型处理更长上下文，注意力层出现注意力分数趋于均匀的病理现象（rank-collapse），虽然注意力缩放方法通过多对数因子β_n重新缩放注意力分数来缓解此问题，但缺乏理论依据。

Method: 分析一个简化但可处理的模型来放大注意力缩放的效果，研究注意力在缩放因子β_n控制下的相变行为。

Result: 发现注意力存在相变：缩放不足时所有token坍缩到单一方向，过度缩放时注意力退化为恒等变换，临界缩放为β_n ∝ log n。

Conclusion: 为YaRN和Qwen中的注意力缩放提供了严格理论依据，阐明了对数缩放能在长上下文中保持稀疏且内容自适应的注意力机制。

Abstract: As large language models scale to longer contexts, attention layers suffer
from a fundamental pathology: attention scores collapse toward uniformity as
context length $n$ increases, causing tokens to cluster excessively, a
phenomenon known as rank-collapse. While $\textit{attention scaling}$
effectively addresses this deficiency by rescaling attention scores with a
polylogarithmic factor $\beta_n$, theoretical justification for this approach
remains lacking.
  We analyze a simplified yet tractable model that magnifies the effect of
attention scaling. In this model, attention exhibits a phase transition
governed by the scaling factor $\beta_n$: insufficient scaling collapses all
tokens to a single direction, while excessive scaling reduces attention to
identity, thereby eliminating meaningful interactions between tokens. Our main
result identifies the critical scaling $\beta_n \asymp \log n$ and provides a
rigorous justification for attention scaling in YaRN and Qwen, clarifying why
logarithmic scaling maintains sparse, content-adaptive attention at large
context lengths.

Conclusion: GDGM框架能够有效捕捉动态交易行为和节点关系，为合谋欺骗检测提供了实用且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for
identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional
machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often
overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based
techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field
by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world
spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular
patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some
scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving
inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models
dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn
representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach
incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal
patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted
into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural
ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the
representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns.
Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques
are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection
performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on
spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing
detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global
trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance
of the proposed method.

processing and analytics. In real-life applications, e.g. social science,
biology, and chemistry, many graphs are composed of a series of evolving graphs
(i.e., temporal graphs). While most of the existing graph generators focus on
static graphs, the temporal information of the graphs is ignored. In this
paper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the
structural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs.
In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph
generators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these
learning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in
training or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods.
Therefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph
snapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose
an attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural
characteristics on sampled ego-graphs. And we proposed an ego-graph decoder
that can achieve a good trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency in
temporal graph generation. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted
among our proposed TGAE and representative temporal graph generators on
real-life temporal graphs and synthesized graphs. It is reported that our
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal graph generators by
means of simulation quality and efficiency.

*Praneeth Vepakomma,Kaustubh Ponkshe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于嵌入共享的差分隐私协作学习方法，通过隐私编码网络和效用生成网络生成具有正式差分隐私保证的嵌入，只需一轮私有化通信且客户端计算量更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协作学习方法基于模型权重共享，而基于嵌入共享的方案在资源效率上有优势，但目前缺乏针对嵌入共享的差分隐私机制。

Method: 设计隐私编码网络和效用生成网络，生成具有差分隐私保证的私有化嵌入，服务器端使用这些嵌入进行后处理完成机器学习任务。

Result: 该方法只需一轮私有化通信，客户端计算量少于传统方法，生成的私有化嵌入可适用于不同类型的服务器模型。

Conclusion: 提出的协作学习与隐私学习的协同设计实现了高效的差分隐私嵌入共享，适用于多种服务器模型类型。

Abstract: Traditional collaborative learning approaches are based on sharing of model
weights between clients and a server. However, there are advantages to resource
efficiency through schemes based on sharing of embeddings (activations) created
from the data. Several differentially private methods were developed for
sharing of weights while such mechanisms do not exist so far for sharing of
embeddings. We propose Ours to learn a privacy encoding network in conjunction
with a small utility generation network such that the final embeddings
generated from it are equipped with formal differential privacy guarantees.
These privatized embeddings are then shared with a more powerful server, that
learns a post-processing that results in a higher accuracy for machine learning
tasks. We show that our co-design of collaborative and private learning results
in requiring only one round of privatized communication and lesser compute on
the client than traditional methods. The privatized embeddings that we share
from the client are agnostic to the type of model (deep learning, random
forests or XGBoost) used on the server in order to process these activations to
complete a task.

*Jiashu Tao,Reza Shokri*

TL;DR: 提出了InfoRMIA，一种基于信息论的成员推理攻击方法，在性能和效率上都优于现有方法，并引入了token级别的隐私分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练过程中会记忆训练数据，导致严重的隐私泄露风险，需要更有效的隐私风险评估方法。

Method: 基于信息论原理构建成员推理攻击，并提出token级别的隐私分析方法，能够精确定位哪些token被记忆。

Result: InfoRMIA在多个基准测试中一致优于现有方法，token级别的分析能够实现更强的序列级推理能力并精确定位泄露位置。

Conclusion: 重新思考了LLM中的隐私问题，提出了更细粒度的隐私分析框架，为针对性缓解措施（如精确遗忘）提供了基础。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they
inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large
language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which
amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy
risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the
release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership
inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership
Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled
information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method
consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved
computational efficiency.
  In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating
sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage.
We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs:
token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA
can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby
localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while
achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope
rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as
exact unlearning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了第一个统一的、可复现的基准测试框架，用于系统评估图神经网络中全局注意力机制与消息传递网络在原子级图学习中的相对贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不一致的实现、特征或超参数调整，目前尚不清楚全局注意力机制何时能真正优于经过良好调优的MPNN层，需要系统性的基准测试来量化其贡献。

Method: 基于HydraGNN构建统一框架，支持四种受控模型类别的无缝切换：MPNN、带编码器的MPNN、MPNN与全局注意力混合的GPS风格模型、以及带编码器的完全融合局部-全局模型。使用7个不同的开源数据集进行回归和分类任务的基准测试。

Result: 研究表明，编码器增强的MPNN构成了稳健的基线，而融合的局部-全局模型对于由长程相互作用效应控制的属性产生了最明显的益处。同时量化了注意力的精度-计算权衡，报告了其内存开销。

Conclusion: 这些结果建立了全局注意力在原子级图学习中的首次受控评估，并为未来模型开发提供了可复现的测试平台。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly
experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds
at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing
to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more
traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range
interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention
mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global
attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to
inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce
the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN -
that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN
with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global
attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven
diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and
classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message
passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study
shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused
local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by
long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute
trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these
results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in
atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model
development.

Conclusion: TimePD框架有效解决了无源域自适应时间序列预测问题，利用LLM泛化能力实现高性能预测。

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series
across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a
variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of
source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a
pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time
series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection
regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time
series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models
(LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities.
Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch
invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and
gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2)
lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates
systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally
aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the
proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习的根本可预测性限制，理解其训练结果不确定性的几何根源

Method: 通过分析深度学习中的混沌学习动态和对称性诱导不变子空间，推导出吸引盆出现分形结构的充分条件

Result: 发现深度学习吸引盆具有无限精细的分形结构，不确定性指数接近零，训练结果的可预测性和可重复性存在根本限制

Conclusion: 分形吸引盆结构为深度学习提供了一个统一解释框架，对优化和AI安全部署具有重要影响

Abstract: Fundamental limits to predictability are central to our understanding of many
physical and computational systems. Here we show that, despite its remarkable
capabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the
fractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that
leads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a
different one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled
basins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning,
including chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces,
to reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting
basins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure
characterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large
increases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in
outcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the
predictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing
a unified account of many empirical observations. These results reveal a
general organizing principle of deep learning with important implications for
optimization and the safe deployment of artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: MCNO提出了一种基于蒙特卡罗方法的神经算子框架，用于学习一维偏微分方程的解算子，通过直接学习核函数并使用蒙特卡罗方法近似积分算子，无需傅里叶神经算子的谱表示和平移不变性假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统傅里叶神经算子依赖于谱表示和平移不变核假设，限制了其适用性。MCNO旨在提供一种不依赖这些假设的替代方法，通过蒙特卡罗积分实现更灵活的算子学习。

Method: 将核函数表示为可学习张量，在离散网格上均匀随机采样一次，通过插值步骤在不同网格间映射，使用蒙特卡罗方法近似积分算子。

Result: 在标准一维PDE基准测试中，MCNO以高效的计算成本实现了具有竞争力的精度，理论分析证明蒙特卡罗估计器在温和正则性假设下具有有界偏差和方差。

Conclusion: MCNO为连续域PDE提供了一种理论支持的神经算子框架，是谱方法和基于图的蒙特卡罗方法的有效替代方案，且可自然扩展到高维问题。

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for
learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations
(PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the
associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier
Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume
translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is
represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling
is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design
enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on
fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an
interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further
enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO
achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also
provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a
bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds
in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond
one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type
integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for
continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to
spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such
as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NEO是一种无需超参数、计算开销极小的测试时自适应方法，通过将目标数据嵌入重新中心化到原点来改善源域与分布偏移样本的对齐，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法通常计算成本高、需要大量数据或对超参数敏感，需要一种更高效稳健的解决方案。

Method: 基于潜在空间几何理论，通过将目标数据嵌入重新中心化到原点来改善源域与分布偏移样本的对齐，开发了无需超参数的NEO方法。

Result: 在ImageNet-C上仅用64个样本就将ViT-Base准确率从55.6%提升至59.2%；在512个样本下在多个数据集上优于7种对比方法，计算成本最低；在边缘设备上减少63%推理时间和9%内存使用。

Conclusion: NEO是一种高效有效的测试时自适应方法，适用于各种ViT架构和数据集，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive,
require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS)指标和正则化方法，用于在概念侧信道模型中平衡准确性和可解释性的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念瓶颈模型(CBNMs)通过概念瓶颈层提供可解释性但牺牲准确性，概念侧信道模型(CSMs)通过侧信道提高准确性但损害可解释性，目前缺乏控制这种权衡的原则性方法。

Method: 提出了统一的概率概念侧信道元模型，引入SIS指标量化侧信道依赖度，并提出SIS正则化来显式惩罚侧信道依赖以提高可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，仅追求准确性的最先进CSMs具有较低的可解释性，而SIS正则化显著提高了可解释性、可干预性和学习到的可解释任务预测器的质量。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发平衡准确性和可解释性的CSMs提供了理论和实践工具。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide
interpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based
exclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also
restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.
Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a
sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant
information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises
interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations
transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled
technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this
gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model
that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we
introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a
CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and
without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which
explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,
we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the
sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs
across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that
state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low
representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially
improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned
interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical
tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a
principled manner.

Method: 开发了归纳图梯度提升机(G-GBM)，将图结构信息与梯度提升森林相结合，利用图神经网络处理异构动态图，同时保持梯度提升的可解释性。

Result: 在模拟随机图实验中与流行图神经网络方法竞争，在开源和真实专有保险数据集上展示了强大的欺诈检测能力，并能应用现有可解释性方法分析预测。

Conclusion: G-GBM成功结合了图神经网络和梯度提升的优势，为异构动态图上的监督学习提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于保险欺诈检测等类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due
to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a
prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals
that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple
policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find
meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance
present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and
dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies.
That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the
field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine
(G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show
that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an
experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power
of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world,
proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting
forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights
into the predictions made by G-GBM.

Conclusion: 为解释量子图神经网络建立了一个原则性的、不确定性感知的、结构敏感的方法，为扩展到更广泛架构和真实数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on
graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by
measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph
structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a
model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as
distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations
of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their
dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance
rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a
distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate
ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of
the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and
confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on
controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and
stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear
surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design.
Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and
structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and
lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world
datasets, as quantum resources mature. Code is available at

TL;DR: vAttention是一种结合top-k和随机采样的稀疏注意力机制，提供用户指定的(ε, δ)近似精度保证，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏注意力方法（如top-k和采样估计）存在根本性限制：无法提供跨头和查询向量的一致性近似，且缺乏近似质量保证，限制了实际部署。

Method: 基于top-k和随机采样的互补性观察，将两者统一，利用采样的统计保证构建具有用户指定精度保证的稀疏注意力机制。

Result: vAttention显著提升稀疏注意力质量（如Llama-3.1-8B-Inst和Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B在RULER-HARD上提升约4.5个百分点），在20倍稀疏度下匹配完整模型质量，在推理场景中实现快速解码而不损失质量。

Conclusion: vAttention是第一个具有实用(ε, δ)精度保证的稀疏注意力机制，为大规模稀疏注意力的可靠部署迈出了重要一步，提供了卓越的质量-效率权衡。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall
into two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and
recently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are
fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail
to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most
critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical
deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:
top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,
whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are
relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical
guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse
attention mechanism with user-specified $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees on
approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a
compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at
scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both
individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our
experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse
attention (e.g., $\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and
Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap
between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model
quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in
reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality
(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with
up to 32K token generations). Code is open-sourced at

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外先验知识，建立了关于输出策略次优性和约束违反的严格理论保证，并可扩展到在线数据设置。

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing
demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and
avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been
several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either
require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and
computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution.
Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs,
i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to
potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we
propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using
standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then
adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward
information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach
significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require
extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees
on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also
extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration
bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space,
and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on
preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference
dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning, particularly sequential
disentanglement, aims to separate static and dynamic factors of variation in
data without relying on labels. This remains a challenging problem, as existing
approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial
networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization
process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when
applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation
protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion
models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical
formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In
this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder
(DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse
real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA
leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient
samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous
testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential
disentanglement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在模式挖掘的邻域自适应广义线性图嵌入模型(NGLGE)，通过自适应图学习和低秩表示重构，解决了传统方法需要预定义邻域大小和单一模式挖掘的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图构建方法需要预定义邻域大小，限制了数据潜在结构相关性的有效揭示；同时基于线性投影的图嵌入方法依赖单一模式挖掘，在不同场景下适应性较弱。

Method: 提出NGLGE模型：1）引入针对邻域的自适应图学习方法；2）利用重构的低秩表示并对投影矩阵施加ℓ₂,₀范数约束，灵活探索额外模式信息；3）设计了高效的迭代求解算法。

Result: 在多个不同场景的数据集上进行对比评估，证明了该模型相较于最先进方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: NGLGE模型通过自适应图学习和模式挖掘，能够更好地揭示数据内在相关性，在不同场景下表现出更强的适应性。

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种学习型调度器来替代掩码扩散模型中的启发式调度策略，通过将去噪过程建模为KL正则化的马尔可夫决策过程，优化了掩码位置的生成顺序选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型在语言建模中表现出色，但其性能高度依赖于选择哪个位置进行去掩码的调度策略。现有方法通常使用基于规则的启发式调度（如最大置信度、最大边界），这些方法虽然能带来临时改进，但缺乏理论保证。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为KL正则化的马尔可夫决策过程，使用显式参考策略，并优化一个具有策略改进和收敛保证的正则化目标函数。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，学习型策略始终优于最大置信度方法。特别是在SUDOKU任务中，相比随机调度提升了20.1%，相比最大置信度调度提升了11.2%。

Conclusion: 学习型调度器能够生成更接近数据分布的样本，在掩码扩散模型中显著优于传统的启发式调度方法。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

TL;DR: 在4人猎鹿游戏中，简单的单词通信将合作率从0%提升到48.3%，而课程学习在迭代公共物品惩罚游戏中反而使智能体收益降低27.4%。研究表明通信比基于经验的训练更可靠，课程设计需注意避免引发'习得性悲观'。

Motivation: 研究多智能体LLM系统中的合作诱导方法，探索直接通信和课程学习两种途径在协调问题中的效果差异。

Method: 在4人猎鹿游戏中测试单词"廉价对话"通信机制，在迭代公共物品惩罚游戏中实施渐进复杂游戏的教学课程学习。

Result: 通信显著提升合作率（0%→48.3%），而课程学习反而降低智能体收益27.4%，定性分析发现强调背叛均衡游戏的课程会引发"习得性悲观"。

Conclusion: 对于协调问题，简单通信协议比基于经验的训练更可靠，社会困境的课程设计需要仔细考虑游戏序列中嵌入的战略教训。

Abstract: Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI
alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum
learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases
cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust
coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly
sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively
complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game
with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing
defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These
findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols
may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design
for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons
embedded in game sequences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过因果分析框架系统评估了异构图神经网络(HGNNs)的有效性，发现模型架构对性能没有因果影响，而异构信息通过增加同质性和局部分布差异来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多默认HGNNs的有效性而未经验证，需要系统性地检验HGNNs是否真正有效，以及性能提升的来源。

Method: 在21个数据集和20个基线模型上进行系统复现和超参数调优，开发因果效应估计框架，通过事实和反事实分析评估候选因素，并使用最小充分调整集、跨方法一致性检验和敏感性分析验证鲁棒性。

Result: 模型架构和复杂度对性能没有因果效应；异构信息通过增加同质性和局部-全局分布差异产生正向因果效应，使节点类别更易区分。

Conclusion: HGNNs的性能提升主要来自异构信息而非模型架构，异构信息通过改善图结构特性来增强节点分类效果。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node
classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks
(HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage
heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly,
aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However,
whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most
studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this
work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and
heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21
datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter
retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a
causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate
factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses,
with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method
consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two
conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on
performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect
by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes
node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/YXNTU/CausalHGNN.

TL;DR: 本文比较了迁移学习场景下多种成员推理攻击(MIA)的性能，发现攻击效果随训练数据增加而降低，且没有单一MIA能捕捉所有隐私风险。LiRA在多数情况下表现最佳，而IHA在高数据量PatchCamelyon数据集上更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型的出现，训练范式从零开始训练转向迁移学习，这使得在敏感应用中使用小规模领域特定数据集进行高效训练成为可能。需要评估迁移学习场景下的隐私泄露风险。

Method: 比较多种成员推理攻击(MIA)在迁移学习设置中的性能，包括Likelihood Ratio Attack (LiRA)和Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA)等攻击方法。

Result: 攻击效果随训练数据增加而降低；没有单一MIA能捕捉所有隐私风险；LiRA在多数实验场景中表现最优；IHA在高数据量的PatchCamelyon数据集上更有效。

Conclusion: 迁移学习场景下的隐私风险评估需要多种攻击方法的组合，LiRA是通用性最好的攻击方法，但在特定高数据量场景下IHA可能更有效。

Abstract: With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training
paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer
learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific
datasets typical in sensitive applications.Membership inference attacks (MIAs)
provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning
models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer
learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by
comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help
practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation.
We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for
score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy
risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio
Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental
scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against
models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型生成合成SNP序列数据的隐私保护框架，通过限制每个SNP序列在训练中的影响来提供差分隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNP数据集对遗传研究至关重要，但共享时存在严重的隐私风险，现有方法要么对统计摘要应用差分隐私，要么需要复杂的后处理和使用公开数据集。

Method: 使用时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型生成合成SNP序列数据，通过限制每个SNP序列的梯度贡献来确保差分隐私保证。

Result: 在1000 Genomes数据集上的实验表明，在ε∈[1,10]、δ=10^{-4}的隐私预算下，该方法能有效生成合成数据集，并显著复制非私有数据集的统计特性。

Conclusion: 该框架在保护基因组数据隐私的同时，为研究人员提供了卓越的灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic
studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs
with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value
reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing
privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical
summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require
post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or
selectively share SNPs.
  In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic
SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden
Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure
that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training,
enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on
full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method
directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.
  Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\varepsilon
\in [1, 10]$ at $\delta=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of
the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly
enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the
statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the
private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional
flexibility and utility.

Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法使用完整SGD轨迹作为对齐目标，但这些轨迹噪声大、曲率高、存储密集，导致梯度不稳定、收敛缓慢和内存开销大。

Method: 用连接初始和最终模型状态的二次贝塞尔曲线作为平滑、低损失的参数化替代品，替代完整的SGD轨迹，提供无噪声、低曲率的监督信号。

Result: 在五个临床数据集上优于最先进的压缩方法，生成的压缩数据集能够支持临床有效的模型开发。

Conclusion: 贝塞尔模式连接作为SGD路径的有效替代品，能够稳定梯度、加速收敛并消除密集轨迹存储需求。

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

TL;DR: 提出了Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF)方法，通过Entropic Annealing和Look-ahead Modulation技术解决粒子滤波在推理时间缩放中的过早利用问题，显著提升数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统粒子滤波在复杂数学推理任务中容易受到过程奖励模型的误导，导致过早利用局部最优解、剪枝潜在正确假设，最终收敛到次优解，特别是在计算预算受限时问题更加严重。

Method: ePF整合两种新技术：1) Entropic Annealing通过监控搜索多样性，在多样性下降时动态退火重采样分布来保持探索；2) Look-ahead Modulation通过评估状态的后续潜力来增加预测指导。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的数学基准测试中，ePF显著优于强基线方法，任务奖励相对提升高达50%。

Conclusion: ePF通过平衡多样化解空间的探索和高奖励区域的利用，提高了粒子滤波的鲁棒性，最终获得更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

Motivation: 传统方法将轨迹转换为固定长度表示，忽略了真实轨迹的可变性，导致信息丢失或特征冗余。需要处理异构数据源和复杂交通动态的挑战。

Method: 使用模态特定编码器和跨模态交互模块捕获空间、时间和拓扑语义；动态轨迹建模机制自适应调节不同长度轨迹的信息密度；采用对比对齐和掩码语言建模的自监督预训练目标。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，MDTI始终优于最先进的基线方法，证实了其鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MDTI框架通过多模态轨迹表示学习有效提升了旅行时间估计的准确性，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous
data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches
typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting
the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to
information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a
novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates
GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE
accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction
module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics,
while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information
density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining
objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further
strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong
generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or

without retraining on paired data. We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method
that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in
flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space
using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through
the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian
computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or
unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the
generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein
structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.

Abstract: This paper studies forecasting of the future distribution of events in human
action sequences, a task essential in domains like retail, finance, healthcare,
and recommendation systems where the precise temporal order is often less
critical than the set of outcomes. We challenge the dominant autoregressive
paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or
order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We
analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify
temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting
objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further
demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by
distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for
selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more
accurate and robust forecasting systems.

Motivation: 传统网格模拟计算昂贵且需要物理参数知识，而数据驱动的图网络模拟器需要为每个参数变化重新训练且数据收集成本高。不同参数模拟共享潜在结构，但现有方法未能有效利用这一特性。

Method: 结合条件神经过程(CNPs)和新型神经算子架构，通过编码图轨迹生成潜在表示，减少时间上的误差累积。使用元学习学习共享结构，实现快速适应新物理参数。

Conclusion: MaNGO通过元学习有效捕获物理模拟中的共享潜在结构，显著提高了对新物理参数的适应能力，同时减少了数据需求和训练成本。

Abstract: Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with
applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional
mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive
and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In
contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer
faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be
retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and
secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter
setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often
share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these
challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling
fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we
propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding
graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error
accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator
architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on
several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties,
demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO
achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle
model.

Abstract: GeoAI is evolving rapidly, fueled by diverse geospatial datasets like traffic
patterns, environmental data, and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) information.
While sophisticated AI models are being developed, existing benchmarks are
often concentrated on single tasks and restricted to a single modality. As
such, progress in GeoAI is limited by the lack of a standardized, multi-task,
modality-agnostic benchmark for their systematic evaluation. This paper
introduces a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance, accuracy, and
efficiency of geospatial embedders. Our benchmark is modality-agnostic and
comprises 7 distinct datasets from diverse cities across three continents,
ensuring generalizability and mitigating demographic biases. It allows for the
evaluation of GeoAI embedders on various phenomena that exhibit underlying
geographic processes. Furthermore, we establish a simple and intuitive
task-oriented model baselines, providing a crucial reference point for
comparing more complex solutions.

Conclusion: 通过平衡组件使用的方法，成功解决了现有混合线性注意力方法中的组件崩溃问题，实现了真正的线性注意力采用，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较三种自编码器架构在12导联心电图异常检测中的性能，其中带多头注意力的VAE-BiLSTM架构表现最佳，并集成到交互式仪表板中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图异常检测对于识别心血管疾病相关的偏差至关重要，需要开发有效的无监督异常检测方法。

Method: 使用三种自编码器架构：卷积自编码器(CAE)、变分自编码器-双向长短期记忆(VAE-BiLSTM)以及带多头注意力的VAE-BiLSTM(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA)，在正常ECG样本上进行训练以重建非异常心脏形态。

Result: 在CPSC数据集上，带注意力的VAE架构表现最佳，AUPRC为0.81，召回率为0.85，优于其他架构。

Conclusion: VAE-BiLSTM-MHA架构在ECG异常检测中表现最优，并成功集成到临床分诊仪表板中，为心电图异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
identifying deviations associated with cardiovascular disease. This work
presents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures:
convolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional
long short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention
(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of
our knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA
architecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG
samples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations
indicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on
the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the
attention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81
and a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other
architectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated
into an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In
addition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is
provided.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JEPAs的防塌缩项不仅防止表示塌缩，还证明能够估计数据密度。通过模型的雅可比矩阵可以高效计算样本概率，该方法称为JEPA-SCORE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现JEPAs的防塌缩项具有更重要的作用——能够估计数据密度，这为数据管理、异常检测等任务提供了新工具。

Method: 利用JEPAs模型的雅可比矩阵在样本点处的值，以闭式形式高效计算学习到的样本概率。

Result: 在合成数据集、受控数据集和Imagenet上验证了理论发现，适用于I-JEPA、DINOv2等自监督学习方法以及多模态模型如MetaCLIP。

Conclusion: 任何成功训练的JEPA模型都可以用于获取样本概率，为密度估计等任务提供了通用且高效的方法。

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able
to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two
objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a
slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

TL;DR: 提出Carré du champ流匹配(CDC-FM)方法，通过几何感知噪声正则化概率路径，改善生成模型的质量-泛化权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度生成模型中样本质量与记忆化之间的基本权衡问题，防止模型仅复制训练数据而非泛化到潜在数据几何结构

Method: 将流匹配中的均匀各向同性噪声替换为空间变化、各向异性的高斯噪声，其协方差捕捉潜在数据流形的局部几何结构

Result: 在多种数据集和神经网络架构上，CDC-FM始终提供更好的质量-泛化权衡，在数据稀缺和高度非均匀采样场景中显著优于标准流匹配

Conclusion: 为研究生成模型中数据几何、泛化和记忆化之间的相互作用提供了数学框架，并提供可集成到现有流匹配流程的稳健可扩展算法

Abstract: Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality
can come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data
rather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce
Carr\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching
(FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the
probability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the
homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic
Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data
manifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from
the data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive
experimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds,
single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various
neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate
that CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We
observe significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in
highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for
science applications. Our work provides a mathematical framework for studying
the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in
generative models, as well as a robust and scalable algorithm that can be
readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning,
often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction
through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack
structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This
paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for
interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a
deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,
enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed
justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the
CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance
against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as
PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves
superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream
training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =
0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative
architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,
establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于正确性而非置信度的解码策略，通过在不同置信度步骤采用不同的采样策略来提高LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在探索多个推理链时存在矛盾：一方面需要注入随机性来探索多样性，另一方面需要保证每个推理路径的质量。传统方法将置信度与答案质量直接关联，但这两者来源不同，需要区分对待。

Method: 提出三种策略：Greedy-Threshold在极低置信度步骤采用贪婪采样；Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon基于估计的按排名正确性设置截断阈值。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中显示出性能提升，挑战了关于不确定性下解码的普遍启发式方法。

Conclusion: 解码规则应该基于正确性而非置信度进行校准，在预期正确性高的标记处采样，在预期正确性低的地方减少采样。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: 科学规则可作为强大的归纳偏置，在数据有限的科学领域实现鲁棒的自监督学习。

Abstract: Transferring the recent advancements in deep learning into scientific
disciplines is hindered by the lack of the required large-scale datasets for
training. We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body
of scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of
governing physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering
Raman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)
measurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating
non-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover
Raman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is
a physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to
disentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the
Kramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss
on the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal.
Trained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and
significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that
training with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any
ground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results. This work
highlights a broader concept: formal scientific rules can act as a potent
inductive bias, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited
scientific domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测对AI可靠性至关重要，但在实际应用中训练数据往往有限。贝叶斯神经网络能明确表示模型不确定性，在小样本场景下特别有价值

Method: 引入基于期望logit向量的贝叶斯后验OOD评分家族，比较了5种贝叶斯和4种确定性后验OOD评分方法

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，使用5000个或更少训练样本的实验表明，贝叶斯方法优于相应的确定性方法

Conclusion: 在小训练数据场景下，贝叶斯OOD检测方法比确定性方法表现更好

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to AI reliability and safety,
yet in many practical settings, only a limited amount of training data is
available. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising class of model on
which to base OOD detection, because they explicitly represent epistemic (i.e.
model) uncertainty. In the small training data regime, BNNs are especially
valuable because they can incorporate prior model information. We introduce a
new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors, and
compare 5 Bayesian and 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores. Experiments on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 In-Distributions, with 5000 training samples or less, show that
the Bayesian methods outperform corresponding deterministic methods.

Motivation: 研究在过参数化插值区域中Gibbs算法的泛化性能，特别是在训练误差较低但可能对随机标签等不可能数据也有效的情况下，建立可靠的测试误差边界。

Method: 使用数据依赖的边界方法分析Gibbs算法在过参数化插值区域的测试误差，并通过Langevin Monte Carlo算法进行近似稳定性验证。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，所提出的边界能够对真实标记数据产生非平凡预测，并正确上界随机标签的测试误差。

Conclusion: 在低温度插值区域的泛化性能已经可以通过更经典的高温度区域中的小训练误差来预示，这为理解过参数化模型的泛化行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: The paper provides data-dependent bounds on the test error of the Gibbs
algorithm in the overparameterized interpolation regime, where low training
errors are also obtained for impossible data, such as random labels in
classification. The bounds are stable under approximation with Langevin Monte
Carlo algorithms. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets verify that
the bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true labeled data and correctly
upper bound the test error for random labels. Our method indicates that
generalization in the low-temperature, interpolation regime is already signaled
by small training errors in the more classical high temperature regime.

Motivation: 解决分子表示学习中交叉验证时的特征泄漏问题，同时降低LOO交叉验证的计算成本。

Method: 提出molFTP表示方法，采用虚拟掩码技术防止特征泄漏，并使用key-LOO近似分子级LOO验证。

Result: key-LOO与真实分子级LOO偏差低于8%，能在几乎全数据训练的同时保持无偏的交叉验证性能估计。

Conclusion: molFTP提供了一种快速、防泄漏的片段-靶点流行度向量化方法，通过虚拟掩码或key-LOO以较低成本近似LOO验证。

Abstract: We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact
representation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature
leakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure
that removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We
further show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true
molecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets.
This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation
estimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast,
leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical
safeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its
cost.

Conclusion: H-DSAC框架成功解决了真实世界强化学习应用中的关键挑战，为自动驾驶提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving with reinforcement learning (RL) has significant
potential. However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due
to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human
expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by
reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we
propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called
Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines
Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to
enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key
innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the
DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected
returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human
intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is
effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state
space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical
training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient
learning for autonomous driving.

Conclusion: BLISS提供了一种无需外部模型的轻量级数据选择方案，能有效估计数据长期影响，显著提升LLM预训练效率。

Abstract: Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models
(LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.
However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained
models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from
those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the
long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,
primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this
paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence
\textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data
selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on
any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the
long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a
surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term
influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We
formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the
upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to
training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,
training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)
leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model
predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of
high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining
410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4
dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$
speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Edit Flow过程通过减少生成过程中必要的编辑操作数量，实现了灵活高效的时序点过程建模。

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event
sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on
autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling.
Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by
jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and
deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this
perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise
to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the
instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we
attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number
of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate
the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range
of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

Conclusion: 通过MASED量化过平滑并应用G-Reg正则化，可以有效缓解深度GNN中的过平滑问题，实现更好的性能表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of
oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis
is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify
the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which
aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this
quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two
different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node
embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight
matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show
that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the
number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise
bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,
adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we
introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and
demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification
accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that
by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in
some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold
start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled
nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size
(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.
This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of
trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of
the GNN.

data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate
proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five
distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center
coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,
especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting
clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results
for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are
near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).
Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a
secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect
ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly. Supplementary materials are

*Lulu Gong,Shreya Saxena*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Tensor-EM方法结合张量方法和EM算法，在线性动态系统混合模型学习中提供可识别性保证和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性动态系统混合模型在复杂噪声环境下的应用受限，现有张量方法在噪声下性能下降，EM方法对初始化敏感且易陷入局部最优

Method: 使用输入输出数据构建矩张量来恢复混合权重和系统参数的全局一致估计，然后通过卡尔曼EM算法进行精炼

Result: 在合成数据上比纯张量或随机初始化EM方法更可靠；在灵长类神经数据中成功建模不同条件为独立子系统

Conclusion: MoLDS是建模复杂神经数据的有效框架，Tensor-EM是学习MoLDS的可靠方法

Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model
time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories.
However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings,
limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment
methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their
performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used
expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent
models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local
minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability
guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the
strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the
construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally
consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates
can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for
all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and
real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves
more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor
or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the
primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in
different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different
conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits
for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset
where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate
that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data,
and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these
applications.

*Nyal Patel,Matthieu Bou,Arjun Jagota,Satyapriya Krishna,Sonali Parbhoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于失败感知的逆强化学习算法，专注于被错误分类或难以处理的样本，从而更准确地恢复RLHF中学习到的潜在奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）中提取潜在奖励信号时，对所有偏好对一视同仁，忽略了最具信息量的失败样本（被错误分类或评分相近的样本）。

Method: 开发了失败感知的IRL算法，重点关注被错误分类或难以处理的样本，通过这些失败样本来恢复定义模型行为的潜在奖励。

Result: 在LLM去毒化任务中，失败感知IRL在多个指标上优于现有IRL基线，无需外部分类器或监督，且提取的奖励函数能更好地反映RLHF的真实目标。

Conclusion: 失败感知IRL是一种稳健、可扩展的方法，可用于审计模型对齐并减少IRL过程中的模糊性，支持更有效的再RLHF训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

*Matthieu Bou,Nyal Patel,Arjun Jagota,Satyapriya Krishna,Sonali Parbhoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于贝叶斯逆强化学习的LLM审计框架，能够推断目标分布、量化非可识别性、提供不确定性诊断，并验证策略级效用，增强LLM对齐的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型隐式优化的目标不透明，使得可信对齐和审计成为重大挑战。现有逆强化学习方法要么产生单一、过度自信的奖励估计，要么未能解决任务的基本模糊性（非可识别性）。

Method: 使用贝叶斯逆强化学习框架，不仅恢复目标分布，还实现三个关键审计能力：量化并系统减少非可识别性、提供不确定性感知诊断、验证策略级效用。

Result: 框架成功审计了一个去毒化的LLM，产生了一个校准良好且可解释的目标，增强了对齐保证。在RLHF中，精炼的低不确定性奖励实现了与真实对齐过程相当的训练动态和毒性减少。

Conclusion: 这项工作为审计人员、安全团队和监管机构提供了一个实用工具包，用于验证LLM的真正目标，推动AI向更可信和可问责的方向发展。

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

Method: 通过研究数据、任务和深度学习表示中的局部性和组合性作用来分析神经网络的学习机制。

Conclusion: 局部性和组合性为深度神经网络的学习能力提供了理论基础，解释了它们如何克服维度灾难并实现泛化性能的提升。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding
of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional
tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of
dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an
underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do
neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact
performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of
training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles
of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning
representations.

Motivation: 现有推理方法依赖间接启发式指标（如问题难度或轨迹长度），而指令调优虽然探索了更广泛的自动选择策略，但很少在推理背景下应用。什么构成"质量"推理数据仍不明确

Method: 提出使用影响力函数来定义推理数据质量，衡量单个CoT示例对下游准确率的因果影响，并引入基于影响力的剪枝方法

Result: 基于影响力的剪枝方法在数学推理任务中始终优于困惑度和基于嵌入的基线方法

Conclusion: 影响力函数可以有效地定义推理数据质量，基于影响力的剪枝方法在推理任务中表现优异

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图描述符的MMD指标只能对生成模型进行排序，无法提供绝对性能测量，且对内核和描述符参数化高度敏感，导致不同图描述符之间的结果不可比较。

Method: 通过拟合二元分类器来区分真实图和生成图，使用图描述符进行特征化，分类器的数据对数似然近似JS距离的变分下界。

Result: PGD指标约束在单位区间[0,1]内，可在不同图描述符间进行比较，并推导出理论上有依据的汇总指标。

Conclusion: PGD相比MMD指标提供了更鲁棒和深入的评估，PolyGraph基准测试框架已公开可用。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these
metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of
performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters,
namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across
different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new
evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the
Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to
distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors.
The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower
bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are
constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different
graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric
that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound
on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate
that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD
metrics. The PolyGraph framework for benchmarking graph generative models is
made publicly available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/polygraph-benchmark.

Motivation: 传统模型压缩评估只关注大小与准确率的权衡，忽视了模型忠实度，这在医疗、金融等高风险领域至关重要。压缩模型必须保持与原模型行为的一致性。

Method: 引入忠实度评估指标，包括使用模型一致性评估预测一致性，应用卡方检验检测整体数据集和人口统计子组中预测模式的统计显著变化。

Result: 研究发现高准确率不能保证忠实度，统计测试检测到了标准指标（如准确率和均衡赔率）忽略的细微但显著的变化。

Conclusion: 提出的指标提供了一种实用且更直接的方法，确保通过压缩获得的效率提升不会损害可信AI所需的公平性或忠实度。

Abstract: In real-world applications, computational constraints often require
transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model
compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost
without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused
on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model
faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like
healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain
faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a
novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond
standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics
that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions
include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the
original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared
tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across
both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts
that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by
applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained
on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high
accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect
subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as
Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more
direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not
compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: 提出了lm-Meter，第一个专为设备端LLM推理设计的轻量级在线延迟分析器，能够实时捕获细粒度的阶段和内核级延迟，为设备端LLM系统优化提供关键洞察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在云端的部署存在数据隐私和可持续性问题，设备端LLM能提供更好的隐私保护和可靠性，但受限于内存和计算资源，需要深入了解性能效率权衡。

Method: 开发lm-Meter分析器，在商用移动平台上实现，无需辅助设备即可捕获嵌入、预填充、解码等阶段的细粒度延迟，系统开销极小。

Result: lm-Meter在Powersave模式下仅造成2.58%的预填充吞吐量下降和0.99%的解码吞吐量下降，具有高分析精度和低系统开销。

Conclusion: lm-Meter为受限平台上的LLM运行时行为提供了前所未有的可见性，为设备端LLM系统的优化和民主化奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications, but their prevalent cloud-based deployment raises growing
concerns around data privacy and long-term sustainability. Running LLMs locally
on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced
privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this
vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as
well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on
resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,
online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures
fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,
decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We
implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high
profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput
reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave
governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies
revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,
quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic
optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the
runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for
informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM
systems. Code and tutorials are available at

Motivation: 多任务强化学习通常依赖任务元数据（如自然语言描述）来指导不同目标的行为，但如何有效利用这些元数据来组合和重用技能仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出LEXPOL架构：使用文本编码器编码任务元数据，通过学习的门控模块选择和混合多个子策略，支持端到端跨任务训练。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中，LEXPOL在成功率和样本效率上匹配或优于强多任务基线，无需任务特定重训练。门控机制能够组合专家策略以处理新任务描述和未见任务组合。

Conclusion: 自然语言元数据可以有效地索引和重组单一策略内的可重用技能，为多任务强化学习提供了有效的技能组合机制。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning often relies on task metadata -- such as
brief natural-language descriptions -- to guide behavior across diverse
objectives. We present Lexical Policy Networks (LEXPOL), a language-conditioned
mixture-of-policies architecture for multi-task RL. LEXPOL encodes task
metadata with a text encoder and uses a learned gating module to select or
blend among multiple sub-policies, enabling end-to-end training across tasks.
On MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or exceeds strong multi-task baselines
in success rate and sample efficiency, without task-specific retraining. To
analyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies
obtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate
composes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task
descriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that
natural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills
within a single policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化设置中的高概率收敛研究需要强假设条件，如梯度有界或噪声渐近消失，导致高概率收敛与均方误差收敛的条件存在显著差异，这与中心化设置中SGD在相同条件下同时实现两种收敛的情况形成对比。

Method: 通过仔细分析感兴趣量(梯度范数平方或最优性间隙)的矩生成函数和用户模型间共识间隙的矩生成函数，提供了去中心化方法在高概率意义下的方差缩减效应新结果，并对强凸成本函数给出了更精细的矩生成函数界限。

Result: 证明了DSGD在相同成本函数条件下同时实现高概率和均方误差收敛，消除了梯度有界等限制性假设，在非凸和强凸成本函数下都达到了阶最优收敛速率，并实现了用户数量的线性加速。

Conclusion: DSGD在高概率意义下保持强性能，与现有均方误差保证相匹配，填补了去中心化设置中高概率收敛与均方误差收敛条件之间的差距。

Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest,
due to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds
and strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP
guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is
understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in
decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded
gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap
between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the
mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic
Gradient Descent ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized
settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same
conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.
Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\mathtt{DSGD}$ in
the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in
HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing
uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while
simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly
convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the
number of users, demonstrating that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong
performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved
results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest
(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap
between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on
the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more
fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of
independent interest.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖昂贵的人工参与数据，限制了可扩展性。需要一种可扩展的方法来模拟人类队友的决策行为。

Method: 在基于Stag Hunt的网格世界捕获游戏中进行了三个实验：比较LLM与人类参与者和专家的决策一致性；通过提示诱导风险敏感策略；在动态环境中测试LLM生成的动作轨迹。

Result: LLM在决策标准应用上比参与者更接近专家；通过提示可以模拟人类风险偏好的变异性；LLM生成的轨迹与人类参与者路径相似。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM尚不能完全复制人类适应性，但其提示引导的多样性为模拟策略不可知队友提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training
agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or
non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive
human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic
data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three
experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory
paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions
from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and
Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward
structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating
consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies
prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM
outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse
and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic
grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce
trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully
replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable
foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

Conclusion: 基于先验信息的适应适合增强基础模型处理高维数据的能力，在真实生物医学数据集中识别出的相关特征与先前生物学发现重叠，同时为未来研究提供潜在起点。

Abstract: Revealing novel insights from the relationship between molecular measurements
and pathology remains a very impactful application of machine learning in
biomedicine. Data in this domain typically contain only a few observations but
thousands of potentially noisy features, posing challenges for conventional
machine learning approaches. While prior-data fitted networks emerge as
foundation models for tabular data, they are currently not suited to handle
large feature counts (>500). Although feature reduction enables their
application, it hinders feature importance analysis. We propose a strategy that
extends existing models through continued pre-training on synthetic data
sampled from a customized prior. The resulting model, TabPFN-Wide, matches or
exceeds its base model's performance while exhibiting improved robustness to
noise. It seamlessly scales beyond 50,000 features, regardless of noise levels,
while maintaining inherent interpretability, which is critical for biomedical
applications. Our results show that prior-informed adaptation is suitable to
enhance the capability of foundation models for high-dimensional data. On
real-world biomedical datasets many of the most relevant features identified by
the model overlap with previous biological findings, while others propose
potential starting points for future studies.

Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how
various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output
prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act
independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves
interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature
contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order
feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients
(IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable
AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural
connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several
theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a
few examples.

rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic
dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates -
system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the
thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon
and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects
generative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through
stochastic thermodynamics.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of
safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as
a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle
graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However,
such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational
complexity, but also the strict modeling assumptions that might yield poor
coverage, especially with labels arriving on the fly. To effect scalability, we
devise a novel graph-aware parametric GP model by leveraging the random feature
(RF)-based kernel approximation, which is amenable to efficient recursive
Bayesian model updates. To further allow for adaptivity, an ensemble of
graph-aware RF-based scalable GPs have been leveraged, with per-GP weight
adapted to data arriving incrementally. To ensure valid coverage with
robustness to model mis-specification, we wed the GP-based set predictors with
the online conformal prediction framework, which post-processes the prediction
sets using adaptive thresholds. Experimental results the proposed method yields
improved coverage and efficient prediction sets over existing baselines by
adaptively ensembling the GP models and setting the key threshold parameters in
CP.

Abstract: This paper formally studies generation processes, including auto-regressive
next-token prediction and masked diffusion, that abstract beyond architectural
specifics. At this level of abstraction, we quantify their benefits and
limitations through measurable criteria such as computational hardness and
learnability. In particular, we demonstrate that allowing generation to proceed
beyond autoregression and current masked diffusion, with capabilities to
rewrite and length-variable edit, can bring significant theoretical and
empirical advantages, with important implications for frontier LLMs that aspire
to tackle increasingly hard problems and work universally across domains beyond
natural language, such as coding and science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着维度增加，探索空间呈指数级增长，而有意义的技能流形仍然有限，因此语义意义对于有效指导高维空间中的探索变得至关重要。

Method: RGSD首先进行对比预训练，将运动嵌入到单位超球面上，将每个参考轨迹聚类到不同的方向。这种基础使技能发现能够同时涉及对参考行为的模仿和语义相关的多样化行为的发现。

Result: 在模拟的SMPL人形机器人（359维观测和69维动作）上，RGSD学习了包括行走、跑步、出拳和侧步在内的结构化技能，并发现了相关的新行为。在下游控制任务中，RGSD优于基于模仿的技能获取基线。

Conclusion: 轻量级的参考引导基础为在高自由度系统中发现语义丰富和结构化的技能提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to high-DoF agents remains
challenging. As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows
exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.
Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide
exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present
Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill
discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD
first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,
clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding
enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference
behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a
simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns
structured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and
also discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD
outperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest
that lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to
discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

TL;DR: 本文分析了大规模语言模型训练轨迹中的量化鲁棒性机制，发现学习率衰减导致验证损失与量化误差分离，通过控制实验证明战略性的训练超参数干预可以改善大规模量化质量。

Motivation: 量化后训练被广泛用于大型语言模型的高效部署，但量化鲁棒性的底层机制仍不清楚。需要准确评估训练动态与量化性能之间的关系。

Method: 对开源语言模型训练轨迹进行全面分析，涵盖32B参数和15T训练token；在控制实验中训练自己的模型达100B token，研究训练动态干预。

Result: 关键发现是量化误差由学习率与其他训练超参数的复杂相互作用驱动；学习率衰减后验证损失与量化误差分离；战略性训练超参数干预可以改善大规模量化质量。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了增加数据集规模必然损害量化效果的假设，证明战略性训练超参数干预可以在大规模下提高量化质量。

Abstract: While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment
of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness
remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation
across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters
and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training
dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization
errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between
learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning
rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely
independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the
training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate
quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled
experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that
increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness,
demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can
improve quantization quality at scale.

Motivation: LLM智能体在解决复杂多步骤问题时依赖外部工具，但搜索智能体的轨迹结构异质性强，标准策略梯度方法存在跨层偏差问题，扭曲了信用分配并阻碍了复杂搜索策略的探索。

Method: 提出Stratified GRPO方法，核心是分层优势归一化(SAN)，根据轨迹的结构特性将其划分为同质层，并在每层内局部计算优势值，确保轨迹只与其真实同类进行比较。

Result: 在多样单跳和多跳问答基准测试中，Stratified GRPO比GRPO性能提升高达11.3分，实现了更高的训练奖励、更好的训练稳定性和更有效的搜索策略。

Conclusion: 分层方法为LLM搜索智能体中的RL结构异质性提供了原则性解决方案，证明了SAN能够消除跨层偏差，提供更纯净和尺度稳定的学习信号。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.
